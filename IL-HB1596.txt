|||Section 5. ||The Children and Family Services Act is amended |
|by changing Sections 4b, 5, 5c, 5d, 7, 7.3, 7.3a, 7.4, 7.5, |
|7.8, 8, 8a, 8b, 9.3, 9.5, 17, 21, 35.5, 35.6, and 35.9 and by |
|changing Section 5.26 (as added by Public Act 102-763) as |
|follows:| ||||
|||(20 ILCS 505/4b)|||||
|||Sec. 4b. ||Youth transitional housing programs. |
|||(a) The Department may license youth transitional housing |
|programs. For the purposes of this Section, "youth |
|transitional housing program" means a program that provides |
|shelter or housing and services to eligible homeless minors. |
|Services provided by the youth transitional housing program |
|may include a service assessment, individualized case |
|management, and life skills training. The Department shall |
|adopt rules governing the licensure of those programs.|||
|||(b) A homeless minor is eligible if:|
|||||(1) |_|the homeless minor|_|||he or she||is at least 16 years |
|of age but less than 18 years of age;|
|||||(2) the homeless minor lacks a regular, fixed, and |
|adequate place to live;|

|||||(3) the homeless minor is living apart from |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his or her||parent or guardian;|
|||||(4) the homeless minor desires to participate in a |
|licensed youth transitional housing program;|
|||||(5) a licensed youth transitional housing program is |
|able to provide housing and services;|
|||||(6) the licensed youth transitional housing program |
|has determined the homeless minor is eligible for the |
|youth transitional housing program; and |
|||||(7) either the homeless minor's parent has consented |
|to the transitional housing program or the minor has |
|consented after:|
|||||||(A) a comprehensive community based youth service |
|agency has provided crisis intervention services to |
|the homeless minor under Section 3-5 of the Juvenile |
|Court Act of 1987 and the agency was unable to achieve |
|either family reunification or an alternate living |
|arrangement;|
|||||||(B) the Department has not filed a petition |
|alleging that the homeless minor is abused or |
|neglected and the minor does not require placement in |
|a residential facility, as defined by 89 Ill. Adm. |
|Code 301.20;|
|||||||(C) the youth transitional housing program or |
|comprehensive community based youth services agency |
|has made reasonable efforts and documented its |

|attempts to notify the homeless minor's parent or |
|guardian of the homeless minor's intent to enter the |
|youth transitional housing program.|
|||(d) If an eligible homeless minor voluntarily leaves or is |
|dismissed from a youth transitional housing program prior to |
|reaching the age of majority, the youth transitional housing |
|program agency shall contact the comprehensive community based |
|youth services agency that provided crisis intervention |
|services to the eligible homeless minor under subdivision |
|(b)(7)(A) of this Section to assist in finding an alternative |
|placement for the minor. If the eligible homeless minor leaves |
|the program before beginning services with the comprehensive |
|community based youth service provider, then the youth |
|transitional housing program shall notify the local law |
|enforcement authorities and make reasonable efforts to notify |
|the minor's parent or guardian that the minor has left the |
|program.|
|||(e) Nothing in this Section shall be construed to require |
|an eligible homeless minor to acquire the consent of a parent, |
|guardian, or custodian to consent to a youth transitional |
|housing program. An eligible homeless minor is deemed to have |
|the legal capacity to consent to receiving housing and |
|services from a licensed youth transitional housing program.|
|||(f) The purpose of this Section is to provide a means by |
|which an eligible homeless minor may have the authority to |
|consent, independent of |_|the homeless minor's|_|||his or her|||

|parents or guardian, to receive housing and services as |
|described in subsection (a) of this Section provided by a |
|licensed youth transitional housing program that has the |
|ability to serve the homeless minor. This Section is not |
|intended to interfere with the integrity of the family or the |
|rights of parents and their children. This Section does not |
|limit or exclude any means by which a minor may become |
|emancipated.|

|||||||(B) were accepted for care, service and training |
|by the Department prior to the age of 18 and whose best |

|the time of placement, the Department shall consider |
|concurrent planning, as described in subsection (l-1) |
|of this Section so that permanency may occur at the |
|earliest opportunity. Consideration should be given so |

|that services and care shall be available on an equal basis |
|throughout the State to children requiring such services.|||

|Department. As a prerequisite for an advance disbursement, the |
|contractor must post a surety bond in the amount of the advance |
|disbursement and have a purchase of service contract approved |
|by the Department. The Department may pay up to 2 months |
|operational expenses in advance. The amount of the advance |
|disbursement shall be prorated over the life of the contract |

|or the remaining months of the fiscal year, whichever is less, |

|||(e) (Blank).|||
|||(f) (Blank).|||
|||(g) The Department shall establish rules and regulations |
|concerning its operation of programs designed to meet the |
|goals of child safety and protection, family preservation, |

|to:|||
|||||(1) adoption;|||

|Court Act of 1987 in accordance with the federal Adoption |
|Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980; and|||||
|||||(10) interstate services.|||
|||Rules and regulations established by the Department shall |
|include provisions for training Department staff and the staff |
|of Department grantees, through contracts with other agencies |
|or resources, in screening techniques to identify substance |
|use disorders, as defined in the Substance Use Disorder Act, |

|to the Department of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, for the |
|purpose of identifying children and adults who should be |
|referred for an assessment at an organization appropriately |
|licensed by the Department of Human Services for substance use |
|disorder treatment.|||
|||(h) If the Department finds that there is no appropriate |
|program or facility within or available to the Department for |
|a youth in care and that no licensed private facility has an |
|adequate and appropriate program or none agrees to accept the |
|youth in care, the Department shall create an appropriate |
|individualized, program-oriented plan for such youth in care. |
|The plan may be developed within the Department or through |
|purchase of services by the Department to the extent that it is |
|within its statutory authority to do.|||

|State and shall include but not be limited to the following |

|services:|||
|||||(1) case management;|||
|||||(2) homemakers;|||
|||||(3) counseling;|||
|||||(4) parent education;|||
|||||(5) day care; and|||

|to assess and meet the needs of children and families:|||
|||||(1) comprehensive family-based services;|||
|||||(2) assessments;|||
|||||(3) respite care; and|||
|||||(4) in-home health services.|||
|||The Department shall provide transportation for any of the |
|services it makes available to children or families or for |
|which it refers children or families.|||
|||(j) The Department may provide categories of financial |
|assistance and education assistance grants, and shall |
|establish rules and regulations concerning the assistance and |
|grants, to persons who adopt children with physical or mental |
|disabilities, children who are older, or other hard-to-place |
|children who (i) immediately prior to their adoption were |
|youth in care or (ii) were determined eligible for financial |
|assistance with respect to a prior adoption and who become |
|available for adoption because the prior adoption has been |
|dissolved and the parental rights of the adoptive parents have |

|been terminated or because the child's adoptive parents have |
|died. The Department may continue to provide financial |
|assistance and education assistance grants for a child who was |
|determined eligible for financial assistance under this |
|subsection (j) in the interim period beginning when the |
|child's adoptive parents died and ending with the finalization |
|of the new adoption of the child by another adoptive parent or |
|parents. The Department may also provide categories of |
|financial assistance and education assistance grants, and |
|shall establish rules and regulations for the assistance and |
|grants, to persons appointed guardian of the person under |
|Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court Act or Section 2-27, 3-28, |
|4-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 for children |
|who were youth in care for 12 months immediately prior to the |
|appointment of the guardian.|||
|||The amount of assistance may vary, depending upon the |
|needs of the child and the adoptive parents, as set forth in |
|the annual assistance agreement. Special purpose grants are |
|allowed where the child requires special service but such |
|costs may not exceed the amounts which similar services would |
|cost the Department if it were to provide or secure them as |
|guardian of the child.|||
|||Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is |
|inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment, |
|garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of |
|a judgment or debt.|||

|||(j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement |
|of a child for adoption if an approved family is available |
|either outside of the Department region handling the case, or |
|outside of the State of Illinois.|||
|||(k) The Department shall accept for care and training any |
|child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or |
|dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act |
|or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.|||
|||(l) The Department shall offer family preservation |
|services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and |
|Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including |
|adoptive and extended families. Family preservation services |
|shall be offered (i) to prevent the placement of children in |
|substitute care when the children can be cared for at home or |
|in the custody of the person responsible for the children's |
|welfare, (ii) to reunite children with their families, or |
|(iii) to maintain an adoptive placement. Family preservation |
|services shall only be offered when doing so will not endanger |
|the children's health or safety. With respect to children who |
|are in substitute care pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act of |
|1987, family preservation services shall not be offered if a |
|goal other than those of subdivisions (A), (B), or (B-1) of |
|subsection (2) of Section 2-28 of that Act has been set, except |
|that reunification services may be offered as provided in |
|paragraph (F) of subsection (2) of Section 2-28 of that Act. |
|Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create a |

|private right of action or claim on the part of any individual |
|or child welfare agency, except that when a child is the |
|subject of an action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act |
|of 1987 and the child's service plan calls for services to |
|facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court |
|hearing the action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act |
|of 1987 may order the Department to provide the services set |
|out in the plan, if those services are not provided with |
|reasonable promptness and if those services are available.|||
|||The Department shall notify the child and |_|the child's|_|||his|||
|family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide |
|family preservation services as identified in the service |
|plan. The child and |_|the child's|_|||his||family shall be eligible |
|for services as soon as the report is determined to be |
|"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or |
|family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse |
|or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its |
|investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected |
|Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's |
|willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the |
|investigation. The Department may also provide services to any |
|child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected |
|child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to |
|services available from other agencies in the community, even |
|if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions |
|in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to |

|subject the child or family to future reports of suspected |
|child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be |
|voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any |
|child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an |
|alternative to an investigation, as provided under the |
|"differential response program" provided for in subsection |
|(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child |
|Reporting Act.|||
|||The Department may, at its discretion except for those |
|children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for |
|care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, |
|as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor |
|requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court |
|Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall |
|be committed to the Department by any court without the |
|approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the |
|effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, |
|2017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the |
|Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or |
|adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of |
|or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor |
|less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under |
|Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor |
|for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency |
|exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a |
|minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition |

|to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section |
|2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, |
|2017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the |
|Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or |
|adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of |
|or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor |
|less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under |
|Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, ii) a minor |
|for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency |
|exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a |
|minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition |
|to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section |
|2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis |
|exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, |
|or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or |
|circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of |
|delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to |
|attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of |
|the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including |
|hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare |
|release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. |||
|||As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective |
|date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and |
|implement a special program of family preservation services to |
|support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are |
|experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and |

|stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a |
|pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines |
|that those services are necessary to ensure the health and |
|safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any |
|family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused |
|and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer |
|the child or family to services available from other agencies |
|in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's |
|home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to |
|future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance |
|of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall |
|develop and implement a public information campaign to alert |
|health and social service providers and the general public |
|about these special family preservation services. The nature |
|and scope of the services offered and the number of families |
|served under the special program implemented under this |
|paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the |
|Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term |
|"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means |
|a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, |
|Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent |
|edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental |
|Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.|
|||(l-1) The |_|General Assembly|_|||legislature||recognizes that the |
|best interests of the child require that the child be placed in |
|the most permanent living arrangement as soon as is |

|practically possible. To achieve this goal, the |_|General |_
_|Assembly|_|||legislature||directs the Department of Children and |
|Family Services to conduct concurrent planning so that |
|permanency may occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent |
|living arrangements may include prevention of placement of a |
|child outside the home of the family when the child can be |
|cared for at home without endangering the child's health or |
|safety; reunification with the family, when safe and |
|appropriate, if temporary placement is necessary; or movement |
|of the child toward the most permanent living arrangement and |
|permanent legal status.|||
|||When determining reasonable efforts to be made with |
|respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in |
|making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety |
|shall be the paramount concern.|||
|||When a child is placed in foster care, the Department |
|shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to |
|prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the |
|child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to |
|reunify the family when temporary placement of the child |
|occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile |
|Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing |
|where the Department believes that further reunification |
|services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from |
|the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. |
|The Department is not required to provide further |

|reunification services after such a finding.|||
|||A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be |
|made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and |
|best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should |
|also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the |
|placement made is the best available placement to provide |
|permanency for the child.|||
|||The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent |
|planning for reunification and permanency. The Department |
|shall consider the following factors when determining |
|appropriateness of concurrent planning:|||
|||||(1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;|||
|||||(2) the past history of the family;|||
|||||(3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by |
|the family;|||
|||||(4) the level of cooperation of the family;|||
|||||(5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the |
|family to reunite;|||
|||||(6) the willingness and ability of the foster family |
|to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;|||
|||||(7) the age of the child;|||
|||||(8) placement of siblings.|||
|||(m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any |
|child if:|||
|||||(1) it has received a written consent to such |
|temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by |

|the parent having custody of the child if the parents are |
|not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the |
|child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, |
|or|||
|||||(2) the child is found in the State and neither a |
|parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be |
|located.|||
|If the child is found in |_|the child's|_|||his or her||residence |
|without a parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible |
|caretaker, the Department may, instead of removing the child |
|and assuming temporary custody, place an authorized |
|representative of the Department in that residence until such |
|time as a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and |
|expresses a willingness and apparent ability to ensure the |
|child's health and safety and resume permanent charge of the |
|child, or until a relative enters the home and is willing and |
|able to ensure the child's health and safety and assume charge |
|of the child until a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the |
|home and expresses such willingness and ability to ensure the |
|child's safety and resume permanent charge. After a caretaker |
|has remained in the home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, |
|the Department must follow those procedures outlined in |
|Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 5-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of |
|1987.|||
|||The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities |
|and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have |

|pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile |
|Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary |
|custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and |
|Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and |
|acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in |
|limited custody, the Department, during the period of |
|temporary custody and before the child is brought before a |
|judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or |
|5-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the |
|authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian |
|of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of |
|the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.|||
|||The Department shall ensure that any child taken into |
|custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical |
|examination.|||
|||A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the |
|temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of |
|the child if |_|the child|_|||he||were not in the temporary custody of |
|the Department may deliver to the Department a signed request |
|that the Department surrender the temporary custody of the |
|child. The Department may retain temporary custody of the |
|child for 10 days after the receipt of the request, during |
|which period the Department may cause to be filed a petition |
|pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so |
|filed, the Department shall retain temporary custody of the |
|child until the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not |

|filed within the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered |
|to the custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or |
|custodian not later than the expiration of the 10-day period, |
|at which time the authority and duties of the Department with |
|respect to the temporary custody of the child shall terminate.|||
|||(m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of |
|age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department |
|that cares for children who are in need of secure living |
|arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a |
|determination is made by the facility director and the |
|Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the |
|facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act |
|of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is |
|subject to placement in a correctional facility operated |
|pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, |
|unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care |
|of the Department before being subject to placement in a |
|correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction |
|has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.|||
|||(n) The Department may place children under 18 years of |
|age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of |
|the Department, appropriate services aimed at family |
|preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the |
|child's health and safety or are unavailable and such |
|placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, |
|clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed |

|in a licensed child care facility may be made by the |
|Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of |
|those children, or by both the Department and the parents or |
|guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the |
|Department for any child placed in a licensed child care |
|facility for board, clothing, care, training and supervision |
|of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of |
|maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for |
|dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. |
|However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases |
|where children require specialized care and treatment for |
|problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, |
|social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable |
|facilities for the placement of such children are not |
|available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in |
|this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall |
|be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or |
|garnishment or otherwise.|||
|||(n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child |
|welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve |
|sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any |
|minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to |
|subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of |
|1987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, |
|provided that the minor consents to such services and has not |
|yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have |

|responsibility for the development and delivery of services |
|under this Section. An eligible youth may access services |
|under this Section through the Department of Children and |
|Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human |
|Services. Youth participating in services under this Section |
|shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing |
|an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how |
|the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A |
|homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any |
|youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The |
|Department shall continue child welfare services under this |
|Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years |
|of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves |
|self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. |
|The Department of Children and Family Services shall create |
|clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to |
|child welfare services under this Section and how such |
|services may be obtained. The Department of Children and |
|Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall |
|disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall |
|adopt regulations describing services intended to assist |
|minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as |
|independent adults. |
|||(o) The Department shall establish an administrative |
|review and appeal process for children and families who |
|request or receive child welfare services from the Department. |

|Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare |
|agencies, and foster families with whom those youth are |
|placed, shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal |
|rights as children and families in the case of placement by the |
|Department, including the right to an initial review of a |
|private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall |
|ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts |
|youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children |
|and foster families. The Department shall accept for |
|administrative review and an appeal hearing a complaint made |
|by (i) a child or foster family concerning a decision |
|following an initial review by a private child welfare agency |
|or (ii) a prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation |
|of subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision |
|concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be |
|conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a |
|current foster home placement is necessary and appropriate |
|under Section 2-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not |
|constitute a judicial determination on the merits of an |
|administrative appeal, filed by a former foster parent, |
|involving a change of placement decision.|||

|||(q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, |
|for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of |
|money or other property which is received on behalf of such |
|children, or any financial benefits to which such children are |

|or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of |
|the Department, except that the benefits described in Section |
|5.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions |
|under Section 5.46.|||
|||The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, |

|Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other |
|miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall |
|be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance |
|with this subsection.|||
|||In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the |
|Department shall:|||
|||||(1) Establish standards in accordance with State and |
|federal laws for disbursing money from children's |
|accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's |
|"||Guardianship Administrator||"||or |_|the Guardianship |_
_|Administrator's|_|||his or her||designee must approve |
|disbursements from children's accounts. The Department |
|shall be responsible for keeping complete records of all |
|disbursements for each account for any purpose.|||
|||||(2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from |

|State funds for the child's board and care, medical care |
|not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and |
|utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by |
|regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, |
|disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of |
|$13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the |
|General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of |
|$13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.|||
|||||(3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing |
|for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). |
|The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant |
|State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child |
|or |_|the child's|_|||his or her||guardian, or to the issuing |
|agency.|||
|||(r) The Department shall promulgate regulations |
|encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to |
|the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons |
|who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a |
|hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names |
|of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list |
|of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the |
|Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the |
|confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and |
|of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every |
|adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing |
|such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an |

|agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The |
|Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the |
|confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and |
|of the child.|||
|||(s) The Department of Children and Family Services may |
|establish and implement a program to reimburse Department and |
|private child welfare agency foster parents licensed by the |
|Department of Children and Family Services for damages |
|sustained by the foster parents as a result of the malicious or |
|negligent acts of foster children, as well as providing third |
|party coverage for such foster parents with regard to actions |
|of foster children to other individuals. Such coverage will be |
|secondary to the foster parent liability insurance policy, if |
|applicable. The program shall be funded through appropriations |
|from the General Revenue Fund, specifically designated for |
|such purposes.|||
|||(t) The Department shall perform home studies and |
|investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation |
|as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and |
|Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:|||
|||||(1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically |
|directs the Department to perform such services; and|||
|||||(2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to |
|the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its |
|reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance |
|with Department rules, or has determined that neither |

|party is financially able to pay.|||
|||The Department shall provide written notification to the |
|court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation |
|and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. |
|The Department shall send to the court information related to |
|the costs incurred except in cases where the court has |
|determined the parties are financially unable to pay. The |
|court may order additional periodic reports as appropriate.|||
|||(u) In addition to other information that must be |
|provided, whenever the Department places a child with a |
|prospective adoptive parent or parents, in a licensed foster |
|home, group home, or child care institution, or in a relative |
|home, the Department shall provide to the prospective adoptive |
|parent or parents or other caretaker:|||
|||||(1) available detailed information concerning the |
|child's educational and health history, copies of |

|excluding any information that identifies or reveals the |
|location of any previous caretaker;|||
|||||(2) a copy of the child's portion of the client |
|service plan, including any visitation arrangement, and |
|all amendments or revisions to it as related to the child; |

|||||(3) information containing details of the child's |

|individualized educational plan when the child is |
|receiving special education services.|||
|||The caretaker shall be informed of any known social or |
|behavioral information (including, but not limited to, |
|criminal background, fire setting, perpetuation of sexual |
|abuse, destructive behavior, and substance abuse) necessary to |
|care for and safeguard the children to be placed or currently |
|in the home. The Department may prepare a written summary of |
|the information required by this paragraph, which may be |
|provided to the foster or prospective adoptive parent in |
|advance of a placement. The foster or prospective adoptive |
|parent may review the supporting documents in the child's file |
|in the presence of casework staff. In the case of an emergency |
|placement, casework staff shall at least provide known |
|information verbally, if necessary, and must subsequently |
|provide the information in writing as required by this |
|subsection. |
|||The information described in this subsection shall be |
|provided in writing. In the case of emergency placements when |
|time does not allow prior review, preparation, and collection |
|of written information, the Department shall provide such |
|information as it becomes available. Within 10 business days |
|after placement, the Department shall obtain from the |
|prospective adoptive parent or parents or other caretaker a |
|signed verification of receipt of the information provided. |
|Within 10 business days after placement, the Department shall |

|provide to the child's guardian ad litem a copy of the |

|foster family home or that their application for licensure is |
|denied or until September 30, 1995, whichever occurs first.|||
|||(v) The Department shall access criminal history record |
|information as defined in the Illinois Uniform Conviction |
|Information Act and information maintained in the adjudicatory |

|of the Illinois State Police Law if the Department determines |
|the information is necessary to perform its duties under the |
|Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, the Child Care Act |
|of 1969, and the Children and Family Services Act. The |
|Department shall provide for interactive computerized |

|communication and processing equipment that permits direct |
|on-line communication with the Illinois State Police's central |

|with all certification requirements and provide certified |
|operators who have been trained by personnel from the Illinois |
|State Police. In addition, one Office of the Inspector General |
|investigator shall have training in the use of the criminal |

|if the record check reveals a felony conviction for child |
|abuse or neglect, for spousal abuse, for a crime against |
|children, or for a crime involving violence, including rape, |
|sexual assault, or homicide, but not including other physical |
|assault or battery, or if there is a felony conviction for |
|physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense committed |
|within the past 5 years.|
|||(v-2) Prior to final approval for placement of a child, |
|the Department shall check its child abuse and neglect |

|registry for information concerning prospective foster and |
|adoptive parents, and any adult living in the home. If any |
|prospective foster or adoptive parent or other adult living in |
|the home has resided in another state in the preceding 5 years, |
|the Department shall request a check of that other state's |
|child abuse and neglect registry. |
|||(w) Within 120 days of August 20, 1995 (the effective date |
|of Public Act 89-392), the Department shall prepare and submit |

|distinct part of the building, are under the exclusive control |
|of the staff of the facility, whether or not the child has the |
|freedom of movement within the perimeter of the facility, |
|building, or distinct part of the building. The plan shall |
|include descriptions of the types of facilities that are |

|checks to determine the financial history of children placed |
|under its guardianship pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act of |
|1987. The Department shall conduct such credit checks starting |

|shall determine if financial exploitation of the child's |
|personal information has occurred. If financial exploitation |
|appears to have taken place or is presently ongoing, the |
|Department shall notify the proper law enforcement agency, the |
|proper State's Attorney, or the Attorney General.|

|||Sec. 7. ||Placement of children; considerations. |||
|||(a) In placing any child under this Act, the Department |
|shall place the child, as far as possible, in the care and |
|custody of some individual holding the same religious belief |
|as the parents of the child, or with some child care facility |
|which is operated by persons of like religious faith as the |
|parents of such child.|||
|||(a-5) In placing a child under this Act, the Department |
|shall place the child with the child's sibling or siblings |
|under Section 7.4 of this Act unless the placement is not in |
|each child's best interest, or is otherwise not possible under |
|the Department's rules. If the child is not placed with a |
|sibling under the Department's rules, the Department shall |
|consider placements that are likely to develop, preserve, |
|nurture, and support sibling relationships, where doing so is |
|in each child's best interest. |
|||(b) In placing a child under this Act, the Department may |

|place a child with a relative if the Department determines |
|that the relative will be able to adequately provide for the |
|child's safety and welfare based on the factors set forth in |
|the Department's rules governing relative placements, and that |
|the placement is consistent with the child's best interests, |
|taking into consideration the factors set out in subsection |
|(4.05) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. |
|||When the Department first assumes custody of a child, in |
|placing that child under this Act, the Department shall make |
|reasonable efforts to identify, locate, and provide notice to |
|all adult grandparents and other adult relatives of the child |
|who are ready, willing, and able to care for the child. At a |
|minimum, these efforts shall be renewed each time the child |
|requires a placement change and it is appropriate for the |
|child to be cared for in a home environment. The Department |
|must document its efforts to identify, locate, and provide |
|notice to such potential relative placements and maintain the |
|documentation in the child's case file.|
|||If the Department determines that a placement with any |
|identified relative is not in the child's best interests or |
|that the relative does not meet the requirements to be a |
|relative caregiver, as set forth in Department rules or by |
|statute, the Department must document the basis for that |
|decision and maintain the documentation in the child's case |
|file. |
|||If, pursuant to the Department's rules, any person files |

|an administrative appeal of the Department's decision not to |
|place a child with a relative, it is the Department's burden to |
|prove that the decision is consistent with the child's best |
|interests.|
|||When the Department determines that the child requires |
|placement in an environment, other than a home environment, |
|the Department shall continue to make reasonable efforts to |
|identify and locate relatives to serve as visitation resources |
|for the child and potential future placement resources, except |
|when the Department determines that those efforts would be |
|futile or inconsistent with the child's best interests.|
|||If the Department determines that efforts to identify and |
|locate relatives would be futile or inconsistent with the |
|child's best interests, the Department shall document the |
|basis of its determination and maintain the documentation in |
|the child's case file.|
|||If the Department determines that an individual or a group |
|of relatives are inappropriate to serve as visitation |
|resources or possible placement resources, the Department |
|shall document the basis of its determination and maintain the |
|documentation in the child's case file.|
|||When the Department determines that an individual or a |
|group of relatives are appropriate to serve as visitation |
|resources or possible future placement resources, the |
|Department shall document the basis of its determination, |
|maintain the documentation in the child's case file, create a |

|visitation or transition plan, or both, and incorporate the |
|visitation or transition plan, or both, into the child's case |
|plan. For the purpose of this subsection, any determination as |
|to the child's best interests shall include consideration of |
|the factors set out in subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of the |
|Juvenile Court Act of 1987. |
|||The Department may not place a child with a relative, with |
|the exception of certain circumstances which may be waived as |
|defined by the Department in rules, if the results of a check |
|of the Law Enforcement Agencies Data System (LEADS) identifies |
|a prior criminal conviction of the relative or any adult |
|member of the relative's household for any of the following |

|which are similar and bear a substantial relationship to |
|any of the foregoing offenses.|||
|||For the purpose of this subsection, "relative" shall |
|include any person, 21 years of age or over, other than the |
|parent, who (i) is currently related to the child in any of the |
|following ways by blood or adoption: grandparent, sibling, |
|great-grandparent, |_|parent's sibling, sibling's child|_|||uncle, |
|aunt, nephew, niece||, first cousin, second cousin, godparent, |
_|or grandparent's sibling|_|||great-uncle, or great-aunt||; or (ii) |
|is the spouse of such a relative; or (iii) is the child's |
_|step-parent|_|||step-father, step-mother||, or adult |_|step-sibling|_||
|step-brother or step-sister||; or (iv) is a fictive kin; |
|"relative" also includes a person related in any of the |
|foregoing ways to a sibling of a child, even though the person |
|is not related to the child, when the child and |_|the child's|_|||its|||
|sibling are placed together with that person. For children who |

|have been in the guardianship of the Department, have been |
|adopted, and are subsequently returned to the temporary |
|custody or guardianship of the Department, a "relative" may |
|also include any person who would have qualified as a relative |
|under this paragraph prior to the adoption, but only if the |
|Department determines, and documents, that it would be in the |
|child's best interests to consider this person a relative, |
|based upon the factors for determining best interests set |
|forth in subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile |
|Court Act of 1987. A relative with whom a child is placed |
|pursuant to this subsection may, but is not required to, apply |
|for licensure as a foster family home pursuant to the Child |
|Care Act of 1969; provided, however, that as of July 1, 1995, |
|foster care payments shall be made only to licensed foster |
|family homes pursuant to the terms of Section 5 of this Act. |||
|||Notwithstanding any other provision under this subsection |
|to the contrary, a fictive kin with whom a child is placed |
|pursuant to this subsection shall apply for licensure as a |
|foster family home pursuant to the Child Care Act of 1969 |
|within 6 months of the child's placement with the fictive kin. |
|The Department shall not remove a child from the home of a |
|fictive kin on the basis that the fictive kin fails to apply |
|for licensure within 6 months of the child's placement with |
|the fictive kin, or fails to meet the standard for licensure. |
|All other requirements established under the rules and |
|procedures of the Department concerning the placement of a |

|child, for whom the Department is legally responsible, with a |
|relative shall apply. By June 1, 2015, the Department shall |
|promulgate rules establishing criteria and standards for |
|placement, identification, and licensure of fictive kin. |
|||For purposes of this subsection, "fictive kin" means any |
|individual, unrelated by birth or marriage, who: |
|||||(i) is shown to have significant and close personal or |
|emotional ties with the child or the child's family prior |
|to the child's placement with the individual; or|
|||||(ii) is the current foster parent of a child in the |
|custody or guardianship of the Department pursuant to this |
|Act and the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, if the child has |
|been placed in the home for at least one year and has |
|established a significant and family-like relationship |
|with the foster parent, and the foster parent has been |
|identified by the Department as the child's permanent |
|connection, as defined by Department rule. |
|||The provisions added to this subsection (b) by Public Act |
|98-846 shall become operative on and after June 1, 2015. |
|||(c) In placing a child under this Act, the Department |
|shall ensure that the child's health, safety, and best |
|interests are met. In rejecting placement of a child with an |
|identified relative, the Department shall ensure that the |
|child's health, safety, and best interests are met. In |
|evaluating the best interests of the child, the Department |
|shall take into consideration the factors set forth in |

|subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of |
|1987. |
|||The Department shall consider the individual needs of the |
|child and the capacity of the prospective foster or adoptive |
|parents to meet the needs of the child. When a child must be |
|placed outside |_|the child's|_|||his or her||home and cannot be |
|immediately returned to |_|the child's|_|||his or her||parents or |
|guardian, a comprehensive, individualized assessment shall be |
|performed of that child at which time the needs of the child |
|shall be determined. Only if race, color, or national origin |
|is identified as a legitimate factor in advancing the child's |
|best interests shall it be considered. Race, color, or |
|national origin shall not be routinely considered in making a |
|placement decision. The Department shall make special efforts |
|for the diligent recruitment of potential foster and adoptive |
|families that reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of the |
|children for whom foster and adoptive homes are needed. |
|"Special efforts" shall include contacting and working with |
|community organizations and religious organizations and may |
|include contracting with those organizations, utilizing local |
|media and other local resources, and conducting outreach |
|activities.|||
|||(c-1) At the time of placement, the Department shall |
|consider concurrent planning, as described in subsection (l-1) |
|of Section 5, so that permanency may occur at the earliest |
|opportunity. Consideration should be given so that if |

|reunification fails or is delayed, the placement made is the |
|best available placement to provide permanency for the child. |
|To the extent that doing so is in the child's best interests as |
|set forth in subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile |
|Court Act of 1987, the Department should consider placements |
|that will permit the child to maintain a meaningful |
|relationship with |_|the child's|_|||his or her||parents. |||
|||(d) The Department may accept gifts, grants, offers of |
|services, and other contributions to use in making special |
|recruitment efforts.|||
|||(e) The Department in placing children in adoptive or |
|foster care homes may not, in any policy or practice relating |
|to the placement of children for adoption or foster care, |
|discriminate against any child or prospective adoptive or |
|foster parent on the basis of race.|||

|||Sec. 7.3a. ||Normalcy parenting for children in foster care; |
|participation in childhood activities.|||
|||(a) Legislative findings. |
|||||(1) Every day parents make important decisions about |
|their child's participation in extracurricular activities. |
|Caregivers for children in out-of-home care are faced with |
|making the same decisions.|
|||||(2) When a caregiver makes decisions, |_|the caregiver|_|||he |
|or she||must consider applicable laws, rules, and |
|regulations to safeguard the health, safety, and best |
|interests of a child in out-of-home care.|
|||||(3) Participation in extracurricular activities is |
|important to a child's well-being, not only emotionally, |
|but also in developing valuable life skills.|
|||||(4) The General Assembly recognizes the importance of |
|making every effort to normalize the lives of children in |
|out-of-home care and to empower a caregiver to approve or |
|not approve a child's participation in appropriate |
|extracurricular activities based on the caregiver's own |
|assessment using the reasonable and prudent parent |
|standard, without prior approval of the Department, the |
|caseworker, or the court. |
|||||(5) Nothing in this Section shall be presumed to |
|discourage or diminish the engagement of families and |
|guardians in the child's life activities. |
|||(b) Definitions. As used in this Section:|

|||"Appropriate activities" means activities or items that |
|are generally accepted as suitable for children of the same |
|chronological age or developmental level of maturity. |
|Appropriateness is based on the development of cognitive, |
|emotional, physical, and behavioral capacity that is typical |
|for an age or age group, taking into account the individual |
|child's cognitive, emotional, physical, and behavioral |
|development.|
|||"Caregiver" means a person with whom the child is placed |
|in out-of-home care or a designated official for child care |
|facilities licensed by the Department as defined in the Child |

|standard characterized by careful and sensible parental |
|decisions that maintain the child's health, safety, and best |
|interests while at the same time supporting the child's |

|to participate in extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and |
|social activities. |
|||(c) Requirements for decision-making. |
|||||(1) Each child who comes into the care and custody of |
|the Department is fully entitled to participate in |
|appropriate extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and |
|social activities in a manner that allows that child to |
|participate in |_|the child's|_|||his or her||community to the |

|fullest extent possible.|
|||||(2) Caregivers must use the reasonable and prudent |
|parent standard in determining whether to give permission |
|for a child in out-of-home care to participate in |
|appropriate extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and |
|social activities. Caregivers are expected to promote and |
|support a child's participation in such activities. When |
|using the reasonable and prudent parent standard, the |
|caregiver shall consider: |
|||||||(A) the child's age, maturity, and developmental |
|level to promote the overall health, safety, and best |
|interests of the child;|
|||||||(B) the best interest of the child based on |
|information known by the caregiver;|
|||||||(C) the importance and fundamental value of |
|encouraging the child's emotional and developmental |
|growth gained through participation in activities in |
_|the child's|_|||his or her||community;|
|||||||(D) the importance and fundamental value of |
|providing the child with the most family-like living |
|experience possible; and|
|||||||(E) the behavioral history of the child and the |
|child's ability to safely participate in the proposed |
|activity. |
|||||(3) A caregiver is not liable for harm caused to a |
|child in out-of-home care who participates in an activity |

|approved by the caregiver, provided that the caregiver has |
|acted as a reasonable and prudent parent in permitting the |
|child to engage in the activity. |
|||(c-5) No youth in care shall be required to store |_|the |_
_|youth's|_|||his or her||belongings in plastic bags or in similar |
|forms of disposable containers, including, but not limited to, |
|trash bags, paper or plastic shopping bags, or pillow cases |
|when relocating from one placement type to another placement |
|type or when discharged from the custody or guardianship of |
|the Department. The Department shall ensure that each youth in |
|care has appropriate baggage and other items to store |_|the |_
_|youth's|_|||his or her||belongings when moving through the State's |
|child welfare system. As used in this subsection, "purchase of |
|service agency" means any entity that contracts with the |
|Department to provide services that are consistent with the |
|purposes of this Act. |
|||(d) Rulemaking. The Department shall adopt, by rule, |
|procedures no later than June 1, 2017 that promote and protect |
|the ability of children to participate in appropriate |
|extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities.|||

|||Sec. 7.4. ||Development and preservation of sibling |
|relationships for children in care; placement of siblings; |
|contact among siblings placed apart. |||
|||(a) Purpose and policy. The General Assembly recognizes |
|that sibling relationships are unique and essential for a |
|person, but even more so for children who are removed from the |
|care of their families and placed in the State child welfare |
|system. When family separation occurs through State |
|intervention, every effort must be made to preserve, support |
|and nurture sibling relationships when doing so is in the best |
|interest of each sibling. It is in the interests of foster |
|children who are part of a sibling group to enjoy contact with |
|one another, as long as the contact is in each child's best |
|interest. This is true both while the siblings are in State |
|care and after one or all of the siblings leave State care |
|through adoption, guardianship, or aging out.|||
|||(b) Definitions. For purposes of this Section:|
|||||(1) Whenever a best interest determination is required |
|by this Section, the Department shall consider the factors |
|set out in subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of the |

|||||(10) "Post Permanency Sibling Contact Agreement" means |
|a written agreement between the adoptive parent or |

|placed in guardianship and the child's sibling following |

|the entry of the Judgment Order for Adoption or Order for |
|Private Guardianship. The Post Permanency Sibling Contact |
|Agreement may be supported by services as specified in |
|this Section. The Post Permanency Sibling Contact |
|Agreement is voluntary on the part of the parties to the |
|Post Permanency Sibling Contact Agreement and is not a |

|of the foster parents, caregivers, and others in |
|implementing the Support Plan. The Support Plan must meet |
|the minimum standards regarding frequency of in-person |

|after their parent's parental rights are terminated, if |
|parental rights were terminated while a petition under |
|Article II of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 was pending. |
|For purposes of this Section, children who share at least |
|one parent in common continue to be siblings after a |
|sibling is adopted or placed in private guardianship when |
|the adopted child or child placed in private guardianship |
|was in the Department's custody or guardianship under |
|Article II of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 immediately |
|prior to the adoption or private guardianship. For |
|children who have been in the guardianship of the |
|Department under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act of |

|the temporary custody or guardianship of the Department |
|under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, |

|as deemed necessary.|
|||||(2) Placement selection for children who are separated |
|from their siblings and how to best promote placements of |
|children with foster parents or programs that can meet the |
|children's needs, including the need to develop and |
|maintain contact with siblings.|
|||||(3) State-supported guidance to siblings who have aged |
|out of state care regarding positive engagement with |

|||||(4) Implementation of Post Permanency Sibling Contact |
|Agreements for children exiting State care, including |
|services offered by the Department to encourage and assist |
|parties in developing agreements, services offered by the |
|Department post permanency to support parties in |
|implementing and maintaining agreements, and including |
|services offered by the Department post permanency to |
|assist parties in amending agreements as necessary to meet |
|the needs of the children.|
|||||(5) Services offered by the Department for children |

|who exited foster care prior to the availability of Post |
|Permanency Sibling Contact Agreements, to invite willing |
|parties to participate in a facilitated discussion, |
|including, but not limited to, a mediation or joint team |
|decision-making meeting, to explore sibling contact. |||
|||(d) The Department shall develop a form to be provided to |
|youth entering care and exiting care explaining their rights |
|and responsibilities related to sibling visitation while in |
|care and post permanency. |
|||(e) Whenever a child enters care or requires a new |
|placement, the Department shall consider the development and |
|preservation of sibling relationships. |
|||||(1) This subsection applies when a child entering care |
|or requiring a change of placement has siblings who are in |
|the custody or guardianship of the Department. When a |
|child enters care or requires a new placement, the |
|Department shall examine its files and other available |
|resources and determine whether a sibling of that child is |
|in the custody or guardianship of the Department. If the |
|Department determines that a sibling is in its custody or |
|guardianship, the Department shall then determine whether |
|it is in the best interests of each of the siblings for the |
|child needing placement to be placed with the sibling. If |
|the Department determines that it is in the best interest |
|of each sibling to be placed together, and the sibling's |
|foster parent is able and willing to care for the child |

|needing placement, the Department shall place the child |
|needing placement with the sibling. A determination that |
|it is not in a child's best interest to be placed with a |
|sibling shall be made in accordance with Department rules, |
|and documented in the file of each sibling. |
|||||(2) This subsection applies when a child who is |
|entering care has siblings who have been adopted or placed |
|in private guardianship. When a child enters care, the |
|Department shall examine its files and other available |
|resources, including consulting with the child's parents, |
|to determine whether a sibling of the child was adopted or |
|placed in private guardianship from State care. The |
|Department shall determine, in consultation with the |
|child's parents, whether it would be in the child's best |
|interests to explore placement with the adopted sibling or |
|sibling in guardianship. Unless the parent objects, if the |
|Department determines it is in the child's best interest |
|to explore the placement, the Department shall contact the |
|adoptive parents or guardians of the sibling, determine |
|whether they are willing to be considered as placement |
|resources for the child, and, if so, determine whether it |
|is in the best interests of the child to be placed in the |
|home with the sibling. If the Department determines that |
|it is in the child's best interests to be placed in the |
|home with the sibling, and the sibling's adoptive parents |
|or guardians are willing and capable, the Department shall |

|make the placement. A determination that it is not in a |
|child's best interest to be placed with a sibling shall be |
|made in accordance with Department rule, and documented in |
|the child's file.|
|||||(3) This subsection applies when a child in Department |
|custody or guardianship requires a change of placement, |
|and the child has siblings who have been adopted or placed |
|in private guardianship. When a child in care requires a |
|new placement, the Department may consider placing the |
|child with the adoptive parent or guardian of a sibling |
|under the same procedures and standards set forth in |
|paragraph (2) of this subsection.|
|||||(4) When the Department determines it is not in the |
|best interest of one or more siblings to be placed |
|together the Department shall ensure that the child |
|requiring placement is placed in a home or program where |
|the caregiver is willing and able to be actively involved |
|in supporting the sibling relationship to the extent doing |
|so is in the child's best interest.|
|||(f) When siblings in care are placed in separate |
|placements, the Department shall develop a Sibling Contact |
|Support Plan. The Department shall convene a meeting to |
|develop the Support Plan. The meeting shall include, at a |
|minimum, the case managers for the siblings, the foster |
|parents or other care providers if a child is in a non-foster |
|home placement and the child, when developmentally and |

|clinically appropriate. The Department shall make all |
|reasonable efforts to promote the participation of the foster |
|parents. Parents whose parental rights are intact shall be |
|invited to the meeting. Others, such as therapists and |
|mentors, shall be invited as appropriate. The Support Plan |
|shall set forth future contact and visits between the siblings |
|to develop or preserve, and nurture the siblings' |
|relationships. The Support Plan shall set forth the role of |
|the foster parents and caregivers and others in implementing |
|the Support Plan. The Support Plan must meet the minimum |
|standards regarding frequency of in-person visits provided for |
|in Department rule. The Support Plan will be incorporated in |
|the child's service plan and reviewed at each administrative |
|case review. The Support Plan should be modified if one of the |
|children moves to a new placement, or as necessary to meet the |
|needs of the children. The Sibling Contact Support Plan for a |
|child in care may include siblings who are not in the care of |
|the Department, with the consent and participation of that |
|child's parent or guardian.|
|||(g) By January 1, 2013, the Department shall develop a |
|registry so that placement information regarding adopted |
|siblings and siblings in private guardianship is readily |
|available to Department and private agency caseworkers |
|responsible for placing children in the Department's care. |
|When a child is adopted or placed in private guardianship from |
|foster care the Department shall inform the adoptive parents |

|or guardians that they may be contacted in the future |
|regarding placement of or contact with siblings subsequently |
|requiring placement. |
|||(h) When a child is in need of an adoptive placement, the |
|Department shall examine its files and other available |
|resources and attempt to determine whether a sibling of the |
|child has been adopted or placed in private guardianship after |
|being in the Department's custody or guardianship. If the |
|Department determines that a sibling of the child has been |
|adopted or placed in private guardianship, the Department |
|shall make a good faith effort to locate the adoptive parents |
|or guardians of the sibling and inform them of the |
|availability of the child for adoption. The Department may |
|determine not to inform the adoptive parents or guardians of a |
|sibling of a child that the child is available for adoption |
|only for a reason permitted under criteria adopted by the |
|Department by rule, and documented in the child's case file. |
|If a child available for adoption has a sibling who has been |
|adopted or placed in guardianship, and the adoptive parents or |
|guardians of that sibling apply to adopt the child, the |
|Department shall consider them as adoptive applicants for the |
|adoption of the child. The Department's final decision as to |
|whether it will consent to the adoptive parents or guardians |
|of a sibling being the adoptive parents of the child shall be |
|based upon the welfare and best interest of the child. In |
|arriving at its decision, the Department shall consider all |

|relevant factors, including|_|,|_|but not limited to: |
|||||(1) the wishes of the child;|
|||||(2) the interaction and interrelationship of the child |
|with the applicant to adopt the child;|
|||||(3) the child's need for stability and continuity of |
|relationship with parent figures;|
|||||(4) the child's adjustment to |_|the child's|_|||his or her|||
|present home, school, and community;|
|||||(5) the mental and physical health of all individuals |
|involved;|
|||||(6) the family ties between the child and the child's |
|relatives, including siblings;|
|||||(7) the background, age, and living arrangements of |
|the applicant to adopt the child;|
|||||(8) a criminal background report of the applicant to |
|adopt the child. |
|||If placement of the child available for adoption with the |
|adopted sibling or sibling in private guardianship is not |
|feasible, but it is in the child's best interest to develop a |
|relationship with |_|the child's|_|||his or her||sibling, the |
|Department shall invite the adoptive parents, guardian, or |
|guardians for a mediation or joint team decision-making |
|meeting to facilitate a discussion regarding future sibling |
|contact. |
|||(i) Post Permanency Sibling Contact Agreement. When a |
|child in the Department's care has a permanency goal of |

|adoption or private guardianship, and the Department is |
|preparing to finalize the adoption or guardianship, the |
|Department shall convene a meeting with the pre-adoptive |
|parent or prospective guardian and the case manager for the |
|child being adopted or placed in guardianship and the foster |
|parents and case managers for the child's siblings, and others |
|as applicable. The children should participate as is |
|developmentally appropriate. Others, such as therapists and |
|mentors, may participate as appropriate. At the meeting the |
|Department shall encourage the parties to discuss sibling |
|contact post permanency. The Department may assist the parties |
|in drafting a Post Permanency Sibling Contact Agreement.|
|||||(1) Parties to the Post Permanency Sibling Contact |
|Agreement shall include:|
|||||||(A) The adoptive parent or parents or guardian.|
|||||||(B) The child's sibling or siblings, parents or |
|guardians.|
|||||||(C) The child.|
|||||(2) Consent of child 14 and over. The written consent |
|of a child age 14 and over to the terms and conditions of |
|the Post Permanency Sibling Contact Agreement and |
|subsequent modifications is required.|
|||||(3) In developing this Agreement, the Department shall |
|encourage the parties to consider the following factors:|
|||||||(A) the physical and emotional safety and welfare |
|of the child;|

|||||||(B) the child's wishes;|
|||||||(C) the interaction and interrelationship of the |
|child with the child's sibling or siblings who would |
|be visiting or communicating with the child, |
|including:|
|||||||||(i) the quality of the relationship between |
|the child and the sibling or siblings, and|
|||||||||(ii) the benefits and potential harms to the |
|child in allowing the relationship or |
|relationships to continue or in ending them;|
|||||||(D) the child's sense of attachments to the birth |
|sibling or siblings and adoptive family, including:|
|||||||||(i) the child's sense of being valued;|
|||||||||(ii) the child's sense of familiarity; and|
|||||||||(iii) continuity of affection for the child; |
|and|
|||||||(E) other factors relevant to the best interest of |
|the child.|
|||||(4) In considering the factors in paragraph (3) of |
|this subsection, the Department shall encourage the |
|parties to recognize the importance to a child of |
|developing a relationship with siblings including siblings |
|with whom the child does not yet have a relationship; and |
|the value of preserving family ties between the child and |
|the child's siblings, including:|
|||||||(A) the child's need for stability and continuity |

|of relationships with siblings, and|
|||||||(B) the importance of sibling contact in the |
|development of the child's identity.|
|||||(5) Modification or termination of Post Permanency |
|Sibling Contact Agreement. The parties to the agreement |
|may modify or terminate the Post Permanency Sibling |
|Contact Agreement. If the parties cannot agree to |
|modification or termination, they may request the |
|assistance of the Department of Children and Family |
|Services or another agency identified and agreed upon by |
|the parties to the Post Permanency Sibling Contact |
|Agreement. Any and all terms may be modified by agreement |
|of the parties. Post Permanency Sibling Contact Agreements |
|may also be modified to include contact with siblings |
|whose whereabouts were unknown or who had not yet been |
|born when the Judgment Order for Adoption or Order for |
|Private Guardianship was entered.|
|||||(6) Adoptions and private guardianships finalized |
|prior to the effective date of amendatory Act. Nothing in |
|this Section prohibits the parties from entering into a |
|Post Permanency Sibling Contact Agreement if the adoption |
|or private guardianship was finalized prior to the |
|effective date of this Section. If the Agreement is |
|completed and signed by the parties, the Department shall |
|include the Post Permanency Sibling Contact Agreement in |
|the child's Post Adoption or Private Guardianship case |

|record and in the case file of siblings who are parties to |
|the agreement who are in the Department's custody or |
|guardianship. |||

|immunization checks.|
|||(a) As used in this Section, "purchase of service agency" |
|means any entity that contracts with the Department to provide |
|services that are consistent with the purposes of this Act. |
|||(b) Whenever a child is placed in the custody or |

|shall be reallocated to new recipients. No later than January |
|1, 2015, the Department shall promulgate rules identifying the |

|||Tuition and fee waivers shall be available to a student |
|for at least the first 5 years the student is enrolled in a |
|community college, university, or college maintained by the |
|State of Illinois so long as the student makes satisfactory |
|progress toward completing |_|the student's|_|||his or her||degree. |
|The age requirement and 5-year cap on tuition and fee waivers |
|under this subsection shall be waived and eligibility for |
|tuition and fee waivers shall be extended for any applicant or |
|student who the Department determines was unable to enroll in |
|a qualifying post-secondary school or complete an academic |
|term because the applicant or student: (i) was called into |
|active duty with the United States Armed Forces; (ii) was |
|deployed for service in the United States Public Health |
|Service Commissioned Corps; or (iii) volunteered in the Peace |
|Corps or the AmeriCorps. The Department shall extend |

|approved or recognized by the Illinois Department of |
|Employment Security or an apprenticeship program approved |
|by the United States Department of Labor; |
|||||(2) not be a recipient of a scholarship or fee waiver |
|under subsection (a) or (b); and |

|youth for a maximum of 5 years after the youth enrolls in a |
|qualifying apprenticeship program so long as the youth makes |
|satisfactory progress toward completing |_|the youth's|_|||his or her|||
|apprenticeship. The age requirement and 5-year cap on the |
|apprenticeship stipend provided under this subsection shall be |
|extended for any applicant who the Department determines was |
|unable to enroll in a qualifying apprenticeship program |

|because the applicant: (i) was called into active duty with |

|applicant served on active duty with the United States Armed |
|Forces, was deployed for service in the United States Public |
|Health Service Commissioned Corps, or volunteered in the Peace |
|Corps or the AmeriCorps. The number of months an applicant |
|served on active duty with the United States Armed Forces |
|shall be rounded up to the next higher year to determine the |
|maximum length of time to extend eligibility for the |
|applicant. |
|||The Department shall develop outreach programs to ensure |
|that youths who qualify for the apprenticeship stipends under |
|this subsection who are high school students in grades 9 |
|through 12 or who are enrolled in a high school equivalency |

|||Sec. 1-5. ||Legislative findings. ||Family foster care is an |
|essential service for children and their families who have |
|been separated due to the tragedy of child abuse, neglect, or |
|dependency. When children have been separated from their |
|families, it is the responsibility of the child welfare team |
|to respond to the needs of the children and their families by |
|means including (i) providing protection and nurture to |
|children in a safe, healthy environment; (ii) meeting the |
|developmental and emotional needs of the children, including |
|maintaining and promoting a child's emotional attachment to |_|a |_
_|child's|_|||his or her||own family; (iii) protecting and promoting |
|the child's cultural identity and heritage; and (iv) working |
|toward permanency for children by connecting them to safe, |
|nurturing relationships intended to last a lifetime, |
|preferably with their own family.|||
|||Foster parents are an essential part of and fulfill an |
|integral role on the child welfare team along with children in |
|care who are old enough to participate in planning and |
|services, parents of children in care, caseworkers, and other |
|professionals serving the child and family. By providing care |
|for children and supporting the attachment of children to |
|their families in a manner sensitive to each child's and |
|family's unique needs, the foster parent serves the child, the |
|family, and the community.|||
|||In order to successfully fulfill their role on the |
|professional child welfare team, foster parents must be |

|committed to the goal of the child welfare program and must |
|provide care to children and promote the best interests of the |
|children and families served. In order to achieve this goal, |
|foster parents must understand and be sensitive to issues of |
|culture, ethnicity, religion, and children's connectedness |
|with their families and must maintain a level of care, |
|conduct, and demeanor that is consistent with the high |
|professional ethics demanded of all other members of the child |
|welfare team.|||

|||(b) When 2 or more persons who work within the same |
|workplace and are required to report under this Act share a |
|reasonable cause to believe that a child may be an abused or |
|neglected child, one of those reporters may be designated to |
|make a single report. The report shall include the names and |
|contact information for the other mandated reporters sharing |
|the reasonable cause to believe that a child may be an abused |

|or service. |
|||(2) Nothing in this Section requires a child to come |
|before the mandated reporter in order for the reporter to make |
|a report of suspected child abuse or child neglect. |||
|||(d) If an allegation is raised to a school board member |
|during the course of an open or closed school board meeting |
|that a child who is enrolled in the school district of which |

_|the person|_|||he or she||is a board member is an abused child as |
|defined in Section 3 of this Act, the member shall direct or |
|cause the school board to direct the superintendent of the |
|school district or other equivalent school administrator to |
|comply with the requirements of this Act concerning the |
|reporting of child abuse. For purposes of this paragraph, a |
|school board member is granted the authority in |_|that board |_
_|member's|_|||his or her||individual capacity to direct the |
|superintendent of the school district or other equivalent |
|school administrator to comply with the requirements of this |
|Act concerning the reporting of child abuse. |
|||Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, if an |
|employee of a school district has made a report or caused a |
|report to be made to the Department under this Act involving |
|the conduct of a current or former employee of the school |
|district and a request is made by another school district for |
|the provision of information concerning the job performance or |
|qualifications of the current or former employee because |_|the |_
_|current or former employee|_|||he or she||is an applicant for |
|employment with the requesting school district, the general |
|superintendent of the school district to which the request is |
|being made must disclose to the requesting school district the |
|fact that an employee of the school district has made a report |
|involving the conduct of the applicant or caused a report to be |
|made to the Department, as required under this Act. Only the |
|fact that an employee of the school district has made a report |

|involving the conduct of the applicant or caused a report to be |
|made to the Department may be disclosed by the general |
|superintendent of the school district to which the request for |
|information concerning the applicant is made, and this fact |
|may be disclosed only in cases where the employee and the |
|general superintendent have not been informed by the |
|Department that the allegations were unfounded. An employee of |
|a school district who is or has been the subject of a report |
|made pursuant to this Act during |_|the employee's|_|||his or her|||
|employment with the school district must be informed by that |
|school district that if |_|the employee|_|||he or she||applies for |
|employment with another school district, the general |
|superintendent of the former school district, upon the request |
|of the school district to which the employee applies, shall |
|notify that requesting school district that the employee is or |
|was the subject of such a report. |
|||(e) Whenever such person is required to report under this |
|Act in |_|the person's|_|||his||capacity as a member of the staff of a |
|medical or other public or private institution, school, |
|facility or agency, or as a member of the clergy, |_|the person|_|||he|||
|shall make report immediately to the Department in accordance |
|with the provisions of this Act and may also notify the person |
|in charge of such institution, school, facility or agency, or |
|church, synagogue, temple, mosque, or other religious |
|institution, or ||his||designated agent |_|of the person in charge|_||
|that such report has been made. Under no circumstances shall |

|any person in charge of such institution, school, facility or |
|agency, or church, synagogue, temple, mosque, or other |
|religious institution, or ||his||designated agent |_|of the person |_
_|in charge|_|to whom such notification has been made, exercise |
|any control, restraint, modification or other change in the |
|report or the forwarding of such report to the Department.|||
|||(f) In addition to the persons required to report |
|suspected cases of child abuse or child neglect under this |
|Section, any other person may make a report if such person has |
|reasonable cause to believe a child may be an abused child or a |
|neglected child. |
|||(g) The privileged quality of communication between any |
|professional person required to report and |_|the professional |_
_|person's|_|||his||patient or client shall not apply to situations |
|involving abused or neglected children and shall not |
|constitute grounds for failure to report as required by this |
|Act or constitute grounds for failure to share information or |
|documents with the Department during the course of a child |
|abuse or neglect investigation. If requested by the |
|professional, the Department shall confirm in writing that the |
|information or documents disclosed by the professional were |
|gathered in the course of a child abuse or neglect |
|investigation. |||
|||The reporting requirements of this Act shall not apply to |
|the contents of a privileged communication between an attorney |
|and |_|the attorney's|_|||his or her||client or to confidential |

|information within the meaning of Rule 1.6 of the Illinois |
|Rules of Professional Conduct relating to the legal |
|representation of an individual client. |
|||A member of the clergy may claim the privilege under |
|Section 8-803 of the Code of Civil Procedure.|||
|||(h) Any office, clinic, or any other physical location |
|that provides abortions, abortion referrals, or contraceptives |
|shall provide to all office personnel copies of written |
|information and training materials about abuse and neglect and |
|the requirements of this Act that are provided to employees of |
|the office, clinic, or physical location who are required to |
|make reports to the Department under this Act, and instruct |
|such office personnel to bring to the attention of an employee |
|of the office, clinic, or physical location who is required to |
|make reports to the Department under this Act any reasonable |
|suspicion that a child known to |_|office personnel|_|||him or her||in |
_|their|_|||his or her||professional or official capacity may be an |
|abused child or a neglected child.|||
|||(i) Any person who enters into employment on and after |
|July 1, 1986 and is mandated by virtue of that employment to |
|report under this Act, shall sign a statement on a form |
|prescribed by the Department, to the effect that the employee |
|has knowledge and understanding of the reporting requirements |
|of this Act. On and after January 1, 2019, the statement shall |
|also include information about available mandated reporter |
|training provided by the Department. The statement shall be |

|signed prior to commencement of the employment. The signed |
|statement shall be retained by the employer. The cost of |
|printing, distribution, and filing of the statement shall be |
|borne by the employer.|||
|||(j) Persons required to report child abuse or child |
|neglect as provided under this Section must complete an |
|initial mandated reporter training, including a section on |
|implicit bias, within 3 months of their date of engagement in a |
|professional or official capacity as a mandated reporter, or |
|within the time frame of any other applicable State law that |
|governs training requirements for a specific profession, and |
|at least every 3 years thereafter. The initial requirement |
|only applies to the first time they engage in their |
|professional or official capacity. In lieu of training every 3 |
|years, medical personnel, as listed in paragraph (1) of |
|subsection (a), must meet the requirements described in |
|subsection (k).|
|||The mandated reporter trainings shall be in-person or |
|web-based, and shall include, at a minimum, information on the |
|following topics: (i) indicators for recognizing child abuse |
|and child neglect, as defined under this Act; (ii) the process |
|for reporting suspected child abuse and child neglect in |
|Illinois as required by this Act and the required |
|documentation; (iii) responding to a child in a |
|trauma-informed manner; and (iv) understanding the response of |
|child protective services and the role of the reporter after a |

|call has been made. Child-serving organizations are encouraged |
|to provide in-person annual trainings. |
|||The implicit bias section shall be in-person or web-based, |
|and shall include, at a minimum, information on the following |
|topics: (i) implicit bias and (ii) racial and ethnic |
|sensitivity. As used in this subsection, "implicit bias" means |
|the attitudes or internalized stereotypes that affect people's |
|perceptions, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner |
|and that exist and often contribute to unequal treatment of |
|people based on race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual |
|orientation, age, disability, and other characteristics. The |
|implicit bias section shall provide tools to adjust automatic |
|patterns of thinking and ultimately eliminate discriminatory |
|behaviors. During these trainings mandated reporters shall |
|complete the following: (1) a pretest to assess baseline |
|implicit bias levels; (2) an implicit bias training task; and |
|(3) a posttest to reevaluate bias levels after training. The |
|implicit bias curriculum for mandated reporters shall be |
|developed within one year after |_|January 1, 2022 (|_|the effective |
|date of |_|Public Act 102-604)|_|||this amendatory Act of the 102nd |
|General Assembly||and shall be created in consultation with |
|organizations demonstrating expertise and or experience in the |
|areas of implicit bias, youth and adolescent developmental |
|issues, prevention of child abuse, exploitation, and neglect, |
|culturally diverse family systems, and the child welfare |
|system. |

|||The mandated reporter training, including a section on |
|implicit bias, shall be provided through the Department, |
|through an entity authorized to provide continuing education |
|for professionals licensed through the Department of Financial |
|and Professional Regulation, the State Board of Education, the |
|Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board, or the |
_|Illinois|_|||Department of||State Police, or through an |
|organization approved by the Department to provide mandated |
|reporter training, including a section on implicit bias. The |
|Department must make available a free web-based training for |
|reporters. |
|||Each mandated reporter shall report to |_|the mandated |_
_|reporter's|_|||his or her||employer and, when applicable, to |_|the |_
_|mandated reporter's|_|||his or her||licensing or certification |
|board that |_|the mandated reporter|_|||he or she||received the |
|mandated reporter training. The mandated reporter shall |
|maintain records of completion. |
|||Beginning January 1, 2021, if a mandated reporter receives |
|licensure from the Department of Financial and Professional |
|Regulation or the State Board of Education, and |_|the mandated |_
_|reporter's|_|||his or her||profession has continuing education |
|requirements, the training mandated under this Section shall |
|count toward meeting the licensee's required continuing |
|education hours.|
|||(k)(1) Medical personnel, as listed in paragraph (1) of |
|subsection (a), who work with children in their professional |

|or official capacity, must complete mandated reporter training |
|at least every 6 years. Such medical personnel, if licensed, |
|must attest at each time of licensure renewal on their renewal |
|form that they understand they are a mandated reporter of |
|child abuse and neglect, that they are aware of the process for |
|making a report, that they know how to respond to a child in a |
|trauma-informed manner, and that they are aware of the role of |
|child protective services and the role of a reporter after a |
|call has been made. |
|||(2) In lieu of repeated training, medical personnel, as |
|listed in paragraph (1) of subsection (a), who do not work with |
|children in their professional or official capacity, may |
|instead attest each time at licensure renewal on their renewal |
|form that they understand they are a mandated reporter of |
|child abuse and neglect, that they are aware of the process for |
|making a report, that they know how to respond to a child in a |
|trauma-informed manner, and that they are aware of the role of |
|child protective services and the role of a reporter after a |
|call has been made. Nothing in this paragraph precludes |
|medical personnel from completing mandated reporter training |
|and receiving continuing education credits for that training. |
|||(l) The Department shall provide copies of this Act, upon |
|request, to all employers employing persons who shall be |
|required under the provisions of this Section to report under |
|this Act.|||
|||(m) Any person who knowingly transmits a false report to |

|the Department commits the offense of disorderly conduct under |
|subsection (a)(7) of Section 26-1 of the Criminal Code of |
|2012. A violation of this provision is a Class 4 felony.|||
|||Any person who knowingly and willfully violates any |
|provision of this Section other than a second or subsequent |
|violation of transmitting a false report as described in the |
|preceding paragraph, is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor for a |
|first violation and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent |
|violation; except that if the person acted as part of a plan or |
|scheme having as its object the prevention of discovery of an |
|abused or neglected child by lawful authorities for the |
|purpose of protecting or insulating any person or entity from |
|arrest or prosecution, the person is guilty of a Class 4 felony |
|for a first offense and a Class 3 felony for a second or |
|subsequent offense (regardless of whether the second or |
|subsequent offense involves any of the same facts or persons |
|as the first or other prior offense).|||
|||(n) A child whose parent, guardian or custodian in good |
|faith selects and depends upon spiritual means through prayer |
|alone for the treatment or cure of disease or remedial care may |
|be considered neglected or abused, but not for the sole reason |
|that |_|the child's|_|||his||parent, guardian or custodian accepts and |
|practices such beliefs.|||
|||(o) A child shall not be considered neglected or abused |
|solely because the child is not attending school in accordance |
|with the requirements of Article 26 of the School Code, as |

|amended.|||
|||(p) Nothing in this Act prohibits a mandated reporter who |
|reasonably believes that an animal is being abused or |
|neglected in violation of the Humane Care for Animals Act from |
|reporting animal abuse or neglect to the Department of |
|Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Health and Welfare.|
|||(q) A home rule unit may not regulate the reporting of |
|child abuse or neglect in a manner inconsistent with the |
|provisions of this Section. This Section is a limitation under |
|subsection (i) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois |
|Constitution on the concurrent exercise by home rule units of |
|powers and functions exercised by the State. |
|||(r) For purposes of this Section "child abuse or neglect" |
|includes abuse or neglect of an adult resident as defined in |
|this Act. |

|||(a) In the case of the death or serious life-threatening |
|injury of a child whose care and custody or custody and |
|guardianship has been transferred to the Department, or in the |
|case of a child abuse or neglect report made to the central |
|register involving the death of a child, the Department shall |
|(i) investigate or provide for an investigation of the cause |

|charged with committing a crime that results in the child's |
|death or near death, there shall be a presumption that the best |
|interest of the public will be served by public disclosure of |

|determines that there is reason to believe that |

|an immediate response.|

|procedures that shall be applied in making this |
|determination, taking into consideration the Child |
|Endangerment Risk Assessment Protocol of the Department.|
|||||(5) May conduct a family assessment on a report that |

|neglect, information relating to developmental |
|functioning, credibility of the child's statement, and |
|whether the information provided under this paragraph (A) |
|is consistent with other information collected during the |
|course of the assessment or investigation.|
|||||(B) The alleged offender's age, a record check for |
|prior reports of abuse or neglect, and criminal charges |
|and convictions. The alleged offender may submit |
|supporting documentation relevant to the assessment.|
|||||(C) Collateral source information regarding the |
|alleged abuse or neglect and care of the child. Collateral |
|information includes, when relevant: (i) a medical |
|examination of the child; (ii) prior medical records |
|relating to the alleged maltreatment or care of the child |

|maintained by any facility, clinic, or health care |
|professional, and an interview with the treating |
|professionals; and (iii) interviews with the child's |
|caretakers, including the child's parent, guardian, foster |
|parent, child care provider, teachers, counselors, family |
|members, relatives, and other persons who may have |
|knowledge regarding the alleged maltreatment and the care |
|of the child.|
|||||(D) Information on the existence of domestic abuse and |
|violence in the home of the child, and substance abuse.|
|||Nothing in this subsection (a-5) precludes the Department |
|from collecting other relevant information necessary to |
|conduct the assessment or investigation. Nothing in this |
|subsection (a-5) shall be construed to allow the name or |

|shall determine whether services are needed to address the |
|safety of the child and other family members and the risk of |
|subsequent abuse or neglect.|
|||Upon completion of the family assessment, if the |

|initial investigation and make an initial determination |
|whether the report is a good faith indication of alleged child |

|determines the report is a good faith indication of alleged |
|child abuse or neglect, then a formal investigation shall |
|commence and, pursuant to Section 7.12 of this Act, may or may |
|not result in an indicated report. The formal investigation |
|shall include: direct contact with the subject or subjects of |

|evaluation of the environment of the child named in the report |
|and any other children in the same environment; a |
|determination of the risk to such children if they continue to |
|remain in the existing environments, as well as a |
|determination of the nature, extent and cause of any condition |
|enumerated in such report; the name, age and condition of |
|other children in the environment; and an evaluation as to |
|whether there would be an immediate and urgent necessity to |
|remove the child from the environment if appropriate family |
|preservation services were provided. After seeing to the |

|safety of the child or children, the Department shall |
|forthwith notify the subjects of the report in writing, of the |
|existence of the report and their rights existing under this |
|Act in regard to amendment or expungement. To fulfill the |

|delivering a child whose life or development may be threatened |
|by a disabling condition, to ensure informed consent to |
|treatment of the condition and understanding of the unique |
|child care responsibilities required for such a child. The |

|program may also encourage parents and other persons having |
|responsibility for the welfare of children to seek assistance |
|on their own in meeting their child care responsibilities and |
|encourage the voluntary acceptance of available services when |
|they are needed. It may also include publicity and |
|dissemination of information on the existence and number of |

|which it appears may result in civil or criminal charges being |
|filed against a person. Program subjects shall include but not |
|be limited to the gathering of evidence with a view toward |
|presenting such evidence in court and the involvement of State |
|or local law enforcement agencies in the investigation. The |

|||(1) The purpose of this Act is to secure for each minor |
|subject hereto such care and guidance, preferably in |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his or her||own home, as will serve the safety and |
|moral, emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the minor |
|and the best interests of the community; to preserve and |
|strengthen the minor's family ties whenever possible, removing |
_|the minor|_|||him or her||from the custody of |_|the minor's|_|||his
or her|||
|parents only when |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||safety or welfare or |
|the protection of the public cannot be adequately safeguarded |
|without removal; if the child is removed from the custody of |
_|the minor's|_|||his or her||parent, the Department of Children and |
|Family Services immediately shall consider concurrent |
|planning, as described in Section 5 of the Children and Family |
|Services Act so that permanency may occur at the earliest |
|opportunity; consideration should be given so that if |
|reunification fails or is delayed, the placement made is the |
|best available placement to provide permanency for the child; |
|and, when the minor is removed from |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||own |
|family, to secure for |_|the minor|_|||him or her||custody, care and |

|discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which |
|should be given by |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||parents, and in cases |
|where it should and can properly be done to place the minor in |
|a family home so that |_|the minor|_|||he or she||may become a member |
|of the family by legal adoption or otherwise. Provided that a |
|ground for unfitness under the Adoption Act can be met, it may |
|be appropriate to expedite termination of parental rights:|||||
|||||(a) when reasonable efforts are inappropriate, or have |
|been provided and were unsuccessful, and there are |
|aggravating circumstances including, but not limited to, |
|those cases in which (i) the child or another child of that |
|child's parent was (A) abandoned, (B) tortured, or (C) |
|chronically abused or (ii) the parent is criminally |
|convicted of (A) first degree murder or second degree |
|murder of any child, (B) attempt or conspiracy to commit |
|first degree murder or second degree murder of any child, |
|(C) solicitation to commit murder, solicitation to commit |
|murder for hire, solicitation to commit second degree |
|murder of any child, or aggravated assault in violation of |
|subdivision (a)(13) of Section 12-2 of the Criminal Code |
|of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, or (D) aggravated |
|criminal sexual assault in violation of Section |
|11-1.40(a)(1) or 12-14.1(a)(1) of the Criminal Code of |
|1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012; or|||||
|||||(b) when the parental rights of a parent with respect |
|to another child of the parent have been involuntarily |

|terminated; or|||||
|||||(c) in those extreme cases in which the parent's |
|incapacity to care for the child, combined with an |
|extremely poor prognosis for treatment or rehabilitation, |
|justifies expedited termination of parental rights.|||
|||(2) In all proceedings under this Act the court may direct |
|the course thereof so as promptly to ascertain the |
|jurisdictional facts and fully to gather information bearing |
|upon the current condition and future welfare of persons |
|subject to this Act. This Act shall be administered in a spirit |
|of humane concern, not only for the rights of the parties, but |
|also for the fears and the limits of understanding of all who |
|appear before the court.|||
|||(3) In all procedures under this Act, the following shall |
|apply:|||||
|||||(a) The procedural rights assured to the minor shall |
|be the rights of adults unless specifically precluded by |
|laws which enhance the protection of such minors.|||||
|||||(b) Every child has a right to services necessary to |
_|the child's|_|||his or her||safety and proper development, |
|including health, education and social services.|||||
|||||(c) The parents' right to the custody of their child |
|shall not prevail when the court determines that it is |
|contrary to the health, safety, and best interests of the |
|child.|||
|||(4) This Act shall be liberally construed to carry out the |

|foregoing purpose and policy.|||

|the subject of the proceeding and |_|the minor's|_|||his or her|||
|parents, guardian, legal custodian or responsible relative who |
|are parties respondent have the right to be present, to be |

|cross-examine witnesses, to examine pertinent court files and |
|records and also, although proceedings under this Act are not |
|intended to be adversary in character, the right to be |
|represented by counsel. At the request of any party |
|financially unable to employ counsel, with the exception of a |
|foster parent permitted to intervene under this Section, the |
|court shall appoint the Public Defender or such other counsel |
|as the case may require. Counsel appointed for the minor and |

|court proceeding, and such appointment shall continue through |
|the permanency hearings and termination of parental rights |
|proceedings subject to withdrawal, vacating of appointment, or |

|ad litem is a licensed attorney at law of this State, or in the |
|event that a court appointed special advocate has been |
|appointed as guardian ad litem and counsel has been appointed |

|||In addition to the foregoing right to be heard by the |
|court, any current foster parent or relative caregiver of a |

|||Any foster parent or relative caregiver who is denied |_|the|_||
|his or her||right to be heard under this Section may bring a |

|Procedure against the court or any public agency to enforce |
|that right. The mandamus action may be brought immediately |
|upon the denial of those rights but in no event later than 30 |
|days after the foster parent has been denied the right to be |
|heard.|||

|||(b) If after an adjudication that a minor is abused or |
|neglected as provided under Section 2-21 of this Act and a |
|motion has been made to restore the minor to any parent, |
|guardian, or legal custodian found by the court to have caused |
|the neglect or to have inflicted the abuse on the minor, a |
|foster parent may file a motion to intervene in the proceeding |
|for the sole purpose of requesting that the minor be placed |
|with the foster parent, provided that the foster parent (i) is |
|the current foster parent of the minor or (ii) has previously |
|been a foster parent for the minor for one year or more, has a |
|foster care license or is eligible for a license or is not |
|required to have a license, and is not the subject of any |
|findings of abuse or neglect of any child. The juvenile court |
|may only enter orders placing a minor with a specific foster |
|parent under this subsection (2)(b) and nothing in this |
|Section shall be construed to confer any jurisdiction or |
|authority on the juvenile court to issue any other orders |
|requiring the appointed guardian or custodian of a minor to |
|place the minor in a designated foster home or facility. This |
|Section is not intended to encompass any matters that are |
|within the scope or determinable under the administrative and |

|shall relieve the court of its responsibility, under Section |

|and the child can be cared for at home without endangering the |
|child's health or safety and, if reunification is not in the |
|best interests of the minor, to find another permanent home |
|for the minor. Nothing in this Section, or in any order issued |
|by the court with respect to the placement of a minor with a |
|foster parent, shall impair the ability of the Department of |
|Children and Family Services, or anyone else authorized under |
|Section 5 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, to |
|remove a minor from the home of a foster parent if the |
|Department of Children and Family Services or the person |
|removing the minor has reason to believe that the |
|circumstances or conditions of the minor are such that |
|continuing in the residence or care of the foster parent will |
|jeopardize the child's health and safety or present an |
|imminent risk of harm to that minor's life.|||

|if the minor's placement is being terminated from that foster |
|parent's home, that foster parent shall have standing and |
|intervenor status except in those circumstances where the |
|Department of Children and Family Services or anyone else |
|authorized under Section 5 of the Abused and Neglected Child |
|Reporting Act has removed the minor from the foster parent |
|because of a reasonable belief that the circumstances or |

|conditions of the minor are such that continuing in the |
|residence or care of the foster parent will jeopardize the |
|child's health or safety or presents an imminent risk of harm |
|to the minor's life.|||

|appearance before the court by the minor, |_|the minor's|_|||his|||
|parents, guardian, custodian or responsible relative, the |
|court shall explain the nature of the proceedings and inform |
|the parties of their rights under the first 2 paragraphs of |

|||When the court finds that a child is an abused, neglected, |

|the parents must cooperate with the Department of Children and |
|Family Services, comply with the terms of the service plans, |
|and correct the conditions that require the child to be in |
|care, or risk termination of their parental rights.|||
|||(4) No sanction may be applied against the minor who is the |
|subject of the proceedings by reason of |_|the minor's|_|||his|||
|refusal or failure to testify in the course of any hearing held |
|prior to final adjudication under Section 2-22, 3-23, 4-20 or |
|5-705.|||
|||(5) In the discretion of the court, the minor may be |

|crime victim, as defined in Section 3 of the Rights of Crime |
|Victims and Witnesses Act, shall be excluded from any hearing |
|and, except for the persons specified in this Section only |
|persons, including representatives of agencies and |
|associations, who in the opinion of the court have a direct |
|interest in the case or in the work of the court shall be |
|admitted to the hearing. However, the court may, for the |
|minor's safety and protection and for good cause shown, |
|prohibit any person or agency present in court from further |
|disclosing the minor's identity. Nothing in this subsection |
|(6) prevents the court from allowing other juveniles to be |
|present or to participate in a court session being held under |
|the Juvenile Drug Court Treatment Act.|||
|||(7) A party shall not be entitled to exercise the right to |
|a substitution of a judge without cause under subdivision |
|(a)(2) of Section 2-1001 of the Code of Civil Procedure in a |
|proceeding under this Act if the judge is currently assigned |

|and the court finds that the conduct and behavior of the minor |
|may endanger the health, person, welfare, or property of |_|the |_
_|minor|_|||himself||or others or that the circumstances of |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his||home environment may endanger |_|the minor's|_|||his|||
|health, person, welfare or property, a warrant may be issued |

|person with whom the minor resides that the minor has been |

|Neglected Child Reporting Act or the nearest Department of |
|Children and Family Services office. If there is reasonable |

|2-3 or 2-4 of this Act taken into temporary protective custody |
|must be brought before a judicial officer within 48 hours, |
|exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and court-designated holidays, |

|all witnesses present shall be examined before the court in |
|relation to any matter connected with the allegations made in |
|the petition.|||
|||(1) If the court finds that there is not probable cause to |
|believe that the minor is abused, neglected or dependent it |
|shall release the minor and dismiss the petition.|||
|||(2) If the court finds that there is probable cause to |

|believe that the minor is abused, neglected or dependent, the |
|court shall state in writing the factual basis supporting its |
|finding and the minor, |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||parent, |
|guardian, custodian and other persons able to give relevant |
|testimony shall be examined before the court. The Department |
|of Children and Family Services shall give testimony |
|concerning indicated reports of abuse and neglect, of which |
|they are aware through the central registry, involving the |
|minor's parent, guardian or custodian. After such testimony, |
|the court may, consistent with the health, safety and best |
|interests of the minor, enter an order that the minor shall be |
|released upon the request of parent, guardian or custodian if |
|the parent, guardian or custodian appears to take custody. If |
|it is determined that a parent's, guardian's, or custodian's |
|compliance with critical services mitigates the necessity for |
|removal of the minor from |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||home, the |
|court may enter an Order of Protection setting forth |
|reasonable conditions of behavior that a parent, guardian, or |
|custodian must observe for a specified period of time, not to |
|exceed 12 months, without a violation; provided, however, that |
|the 12-month period shall begin anew after any violation. |
|"Custodian" includes the Department of Children and Family |
|Services, if it has been given custody of the child, or any |
|other agency of the State which has been given custody or |
|wardship of the child. If it is consistent with the health, |
|safety and best interests of the minor, the court may also |

|prescribe shelter care and order that the minor be kept in a |
|suitable place designated by the court or in a shelter care |
|facility designated by the Department of Children and Family |
|Services or a licensed child welfare agency; however, on and |
|after January 1, 2015 (the effective date of Public Act |
|98-803) and before January 1, 2017, a minor charged with a |
|criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the |
|Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be |
|placed in the custody of or committed to the Department of |
|Children and Family Services by any court, except a minor less |
|than 16 years of age and committed to the Department of |
|Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 of this Act |
|or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or |
|dependency exists; and on and after January 1, 2017, a minor |
|charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of |
|1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent |
|shall not be placed in the custody of or committed to the |
|Department of Children and Family Services by any court, |
|except a minor less than 15 years of age and committed to the |
|Department of Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 |
|of this Act or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, |
|neglect, or dependency exists. An independent basis exists |
|when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, or |
|dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or |
|circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of |
|delinquency. |

|||In placing the minor, the Department or other agency |
|shall, to the extent compatible with the court's order, comply |
|with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act. In |
|determining the health, safety and best interests of the minor |
|to prescribe shelter care, the court must find that it is a |
|matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the safety and |
|protection of the minor or of the person or property of another |
|that the minor be placed in a shelter care facility or that |_|the |_
_|minor|_|||he or she||is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the |
|court, and must further find that reasonable efforts have been |
|made or that, consistent with the health, safety and best |
|interests of the minor, no efforts reasonably can be made to |
|prevent or eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor |
|from |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||home. The court shall require |
|documentation from the Department of Children and Family |
|Services as to the reasonable efforts that were made to |
|prevent or eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor |
|from |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||home or the reasons why no efforts |
|reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the necessity |
|of removal. When a minor is placed in the home of a relative, |
|the Department of Children and Family Services shall complete |
|a preliminary background review of the members of the minor's |
|custodian's household in accordance with Section 4.3 of the |
|Child Care Act of 1969 within 90 days of that placement. If the |
|minor is ordered placed in a shelter care facility of the |
|Department of Children and Family Services or a licensed child |

|welfare agency, the court shall, upon request of the |
|appropriate Department or other agency, appoint the Department |
|of Children and Family Services Guardianship Administrator or |
|other appropriate agency executive temporary custodian of the |
|minor and the court may enter such other orders related to the |
|temporary custody as it deems fit and proper, including the |
|provision of services to the minor or |_|the minor's|_|||his||family to |
|ameliorate the causes contributing to the finding of probable |
|cause or to the finding of the existence of immediate and |
|urgent necessity.|
|||Where the Department of Children and Family Services |
|Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive |
|temporary custodian, the Department of Children and Family |
|Services shall file with the court and serve on the parties a |
|parent-child visiting plan, within 10 days, excluding weekends |
|and holidays, after the appointment. The parent-child visiting |
|plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency |
|of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the |
|visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to |
|have telephone and mail communication with the parents.|
|||Where the Department of Children and Family Services |
|Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive |
|temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, |
|the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with |
|the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and |
|contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, |

|after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan |
|shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and |
|if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are |
|being made to place them together. If the Department has |
|determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be |
|placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the |
|sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its |
|determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling |
|placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for |
|visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who |
|shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the |
|child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in |
|addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it |
|is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a |
|sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling |
|placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. |
|The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date |
|for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under |
|subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family |
|Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling |
|Contact Support Plan is developed. |
|||For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to |
|file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement |
|and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. |
|Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the |
|parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is |

|reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the |
|achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion, |
|request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or |
|the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it |
|is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may |
|refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, |
|duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the |
|needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of |
|Department personnel. Child development principles shall be |
|considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent |
|visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should |
|take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the |
|party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the |
|court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not |
|reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the |
|achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions |
|placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact |
|are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall |
|put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination |
|and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court |
|shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes |
|to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or |
|contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any |
|stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court |
|to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child |
|visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan or |

|subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing |
|under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from |
|granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase |
|opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling |
|contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this |
|subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately |
|restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling |
|contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting |
|plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order, |
|where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there |
|is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, |
|and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based |
|on available facts to the Department and its assigns when |
|viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall |
|only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department |
|shall file with the court and serve on the parties any |
|amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and |
|holidays, of the change of the visitation.|
|||Acceptance of services shall not be considered an |
|admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to |
|this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as |
|evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where |
|the issue is whether the Department has made reasonable |
|efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it |
|is consistent with the health, safety and best interests of |
|the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in |

|writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings |
|concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the |
|protection of the minor or of the person or property of another |
|and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that |
|reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the |
|removal of the minor from |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||home or that |
|no efforts reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate |
|the removal of the minor from |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||home. The |
|parents, guardian, custodian, temporary custodian and minor |
|shall each be furnished a copy of such written findings. The |
|temporary custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order |
|and written findings in the case record for the child. The |
|order together with the court's findings of fact in support |
|thereof shall be entered of record in the court.|||
|||Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and |
|urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the |
|minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not |
|be returned to the parent, custodian or guardian until the |
|court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the |
|protection of the minor.|||
|||If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the |
|Department of Children and Family Services for |_|the minor's|_|||his |
|or her||protection, the court shall admonish the parents, |
|guardian, custodian or responsible relative that the parents |
|must cooperate with the Department of Children and Family |
|Services, comply with the terms of the service plans, and |

|correct the conditions which require the child to be in care, |
|or risk termination of their parental rights. The court shall |
|ensure, by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, |
|custodian or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, |
|custodian or responsible relative has had the opportunity to |
|provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and |
|telephone numbers of each of the minor's living ||maternal and |
|paternal||adult relatives, including, but not limited to, |
|grandparents, |_|siblings of the minor's parents|_|||aunts, uncles||, |
|and siblings. The court shall advise the parents, guardian, |
|custodian or responsible relative to inform the Department if |
|additional information regarding the minor's adult relatives |
|becomes available.|||
|||(3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor |
|described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3 and 4-3 the moving party is |
|unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter |
|care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an |
|ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of |
|issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and |
|entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from |
|the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is |
|renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, |
|or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent |
|efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein |
|prescribed. The notice prescribed shall be in writing and |
|shall be personally delivered to the minor or the minor's |

|attorney and to the last known address of the other person or |
|persons entitled to notice. The notice shall also state the |
|nature of the allegations, the nature of the order sought by |
|the State, including whether temporary custody is sought, and |
|the consequences of failure to appear and shall contain a |
|notice that the parties will not be entitled to further |
|written notices or publication notices of proceedings in this |
|case, including the filing of an amended petition or a motion |
|to terminate parental rights, except as required by Supreme |
|Court Rule 11; and shall explain the right of the parties and |
|the procedures to vacate or modify a shelter care order as |
|provided in this Section. The notice for a shelter care |

|NOTICE OF PARENT'S AND CHILDREN'S RIGHTS|

|TO REHEARING ON TEMPORARY CUSTODY|

||
|||||If you were not present at and did not have adequate |

|notice of the Shelter Care Hearing at which temporary |
|custody of ............... was awarded to |
|................, you have the right to request a full |
|rehearing on whether the State should have temporary |
|custody of ................. To request this rehearing, |
|you must file with the Clerk of the Juvenile Court |
|(address): ........................, in person or by |
|mailing a statement (affidavit) setting forth the |
|following:|||
|||||||1. That you were not present at the shelter care |
|hearing.|||
|||||||2. That you did not get adequate notice |
|(explaining how the notice was inadequate).|||
|||||||3. Your signature.|||
|||||||4. Signature must be notarized.|||
|||||The rehearing should be scheduled within 48 hours of |
|your filing this affidavit.|||
|||||At the rehearing, your rights are the same as at the |
|initial shelter care hearing. The enclosed notice explains |
|those rights.|||
|||||At the Shelter Care Hearing, children have the |
|following rights:|||
|||||||1. To have a guardian ad litem appointed.|||
|||||||2. To be declared competent as a witness and to |
|present testimony concerning:|||
|||||||||a. Whether they are abused, neglected or |

|dependent.|||
|||||||||b. Whether there is "immediate and urgent |
|necessity" to be removed from home.|||
|||||||||c. Their best interests.|||
|||||||3. To cross examine witnesses for other parties.|||
|||||||4. To obtain an explanation of any proceedings and |
|orders of the court.|||
|||(4) If the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible |
|relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor did not |
|have actual notice of or was not present at the shelter care |
|hearing, |_|the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible |_
_|relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor|_|||he or |
|she||may file an affidavit setting forth these facts, and the |
|clerk shall set the matter for rehearing not later than 48 |
|hours, excluding Sundays and legal holidays, after the filing |
|of the affidavit. At the rehearing, the court shall proceed in |
|the same manner as upon the original hearing.|||
|||(5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that |
|the minor taken into custody is a person described in |
|subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or |
|detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This |
|Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).|||
|||(6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a |
|jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners |
|in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept |
|separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept |

|in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant |
|to the criminal law.|||
|||(7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer |
|within the time period as specified in Section 2-9, the minor |
|must immediately be released from custody.|||
|||(8) If neither the parent, guardian or custodian appears |
|within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon |
|request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the |
|clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later |
|than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons |
|directed to the parent, guardian or custodian to appear. At |
|the same time the probation department shall prepare a report |
|on the minor. If a parent, guardian or custodian does not |
|appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order |
|prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place |
|designated by the Department of Children and Family Services |
|or a licensed child welfare agency.|||
|||(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section |
|any interested party, including the State, the temporary |
|custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family |
|under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and |
|Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their |
|representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, |
|may file a motion that it is in the best interests of the minor |
|to modify or vacate a temporary custody order on any of the |
|following grounds:|||

|||||(a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent |
|necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or|||
|||||(b) There is a material change in the circumstances of |
|the natural family from which the minor was removed and |
|the child can be cared for at home without endangering the |
|child's health or safety; or|||
|||||(c) A person not a party to the alleged abuse, neglect |
|or dependency, including a parent, relative or legal |
|guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the |
|minor; or|||
|||||(d) Services provided by the Department of Children |
|and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other |
|service provider have been successful in eliminating the |
|need for temporary custody and the child can be cared for |
|at home without endangering the child's health or safety.|||
|||In ruling on the motion, the court shall determine whether |
|it is consistent with the health, safety and best interests of |
|the minor to modify or vacate a temporary custody order. If the |
|minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal |
|custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an |
|Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court |
|may order the Department of Children and Family Services to |
|arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living |
|arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, |
|and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of |
|protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 |

|or 2-25.|||
|||The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than |
|14 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court |
|modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not |
|vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that |
|appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of |
|the minor and |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||family.|||
|||(10) When the court finds or has found that there is |
|probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as |
|described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an |
|immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be |
|placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall |
|be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household |
|as the abused minor provided:|||
|||||(a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or |
|neglect petition pending before the court; and|||
|||||(b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care |

|||Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has |
|been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate |
|and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing |
|shelter care for the other minor.|||
|||(11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 |
|apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on |
|or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act |
|98-61).|

|||(12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a |
|temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may |
|file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary |
|custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker |
|for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes |
|of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection |
|(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court |
|may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing |
|evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant |
|the temporary custodian such authority. In making its |
|determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in |
|addition to considering the best interests factors listed in |
|subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: |
|||||(a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents |
|and adult family members of the minor and the results of |
|those efforts;|
|||||(b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult |
|family members of the minor in decision making on behalf |
|of the minor;|
|||||(c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) |
|and (b) have been ongoing;|
|||||(d) the relationship between the respondents and adult |
|family members and the minor;|
|||||(e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which |
|the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in |
|decision-making on the minor; and|

|||||(f) any other factor the court deems relevant.|
|||If the Department of Children and Family Services is the |
|temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the |
|requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 |
|of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow |
|its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under |
|this subsection. |

|||Sec. 2-10.3. ||Access to news media.|
|||(a) All youth in the custody or guardianship of the |
|Department of Children and Family Services are entitled to the |
|freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment to the |
|Constitution of the United States and Section 4 of Article I of |
|the Illinois Constitution. The Department of Children and |
|Family Services and its agents and assigns shall not interfere |
|with the right of any youth in its custody or guardianship to |
|communicate with the news media if the youth chooses to do so.|
|||(b) Provisions related to minors under 18. Any time the |
|news media requests to speak with a specific, identified minor |
|under 18 years of age, the Department of Children and Family |
|Services shall immediately provide notice of the news media's |
|request to the minor's attorney and guardian ad litem. The |
|notice shall include at a minimum the minor's name, the news |

|media name, and the date of the inquiry from the news media. |
|Within one business day of the news media's request, the |
|Department shall determine whether the minor wants to speak |
|with the news media, whether the minor has sufficient maturity |
|to make |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||own decision to communicate with |
|the news media and whether contact with the news media will |
|more likely than not cause the minor serious physical, |
|emotional, or mental harm. The Department shall provide notice |
|of its determination to the minor's attorney and guardian ad |
|litem within one business day of its determination.|
|||(c) Provisions related to minors over 18. The Department |
|shall not take any action to interfere with the right of a |
|minor over 18 to speak with the news media.|
|||(d) Court Review.|
|||||(1) Any party may file a motion seeking to enforce |
|rights under this Section.|
|||||(2) If the minor does not have an attorney, the court |
|shall appoint one for purposes of the motion.|
|||||(3) The Department shall facilitate the minor's |
|presence in court for hearings on the motion if the minor |
|wants to be present.|
|||||(4) The party filing the motion shall provide prior |
|notice of the hearing to the involved news media.|
|||||(5) Minors over 18. If the court finds that the |
|Department has interfered with the minor's right to |
|communicate with the media, the court shall enjoin any |

|further interference by the Department with the minor's |
|contacts with the news media.|
|||||(6) Minors under 18. The Department shall have the |
|burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence: |
|(i) that the minor does not have sufficient maturity to |
|make |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||own decision to communicate |
|with the news media and that contact with the news media |
|will, more likely than not, cause the minor serious |
|physical, emotional, or mental harm; and (ii) that less |
|restrictive means are insufficient to address the minor's |
|lack of maturity or the risk of serious physical, |
|emotional, or mental harm. If the court finds by clear and |
|convincing evidence that a minor under 18 years of age |
|lacks sufficient maturity to make |_|the minor's|_|||his or her|||
|own decision to communicate with the media and that the |
|contact with the news media will, more likely than not, |
|cause the minor serious physical, emotional, or mental |
|harm, the court may issue an order identifying the |
|specific limits that the Department may impose on the |
|minor's communication with the news media. The order shall |
|not permit the Department to prevent the minor from |
|communicating with the news media unless it determines |
|that no less restrictive means are available to address |
|the likelihood of harm to the minor.|
|||||(7) The court shall not impose any limitations on the |
|speech of a minor based on viewpoints the minor may |

|express or information the minor may divulge, unless it is |
|confidential information regarding third parties.|
|||||(8) All orders resolving motions brought under this |
|subsection shall contain written findings in support of |
|the court's ruling.|
|||(e) As used in this Section, "interfere" includes, but is |
|not limited to: withholding information from a minor about a |
|news media outlet's request to speak with the minor, including |
|any contact information necessary to respond to the request; |
|preventing a minor from communicating with the news media; |
|threatening or coercing the minor in any manner; or punishing |
|or taking adverse action because of a minor's contact with the |
|news media. "Interfere" does not include:|
|||||(1) providing information and advice about |
|communicating with news media that is consistent with the |
|minor's age, developmental capacity and circumstances, |
|including information about the minor's right to refuse |
|particular questions, the right to condition the |
|participation upon a promise of anonymity or other privacy |
|measures, the right to refuse to speak to the news media, |
|and similar advice designed to enhance the minor's right |
|to autonomy in communicating with the news media; and|
|||||(2) conducting an inquiry into (i) whether a minor |
|under 18 is sufficiently mature to decide ||for themselves|||
|whether to communicate with the news media and (ii) |
|whether communicating with the news media will more likely |

|than not cause serious physical, emotional, or mental harm |
|to the minor under 18. The inquiry in this subsection must |
|be concluded within one business day of the request from |
|the news media.|
|||(f) As used in this Section, "less restrictive means" are |
|conditions on the minor's ability to communicate with the news |
|media that mitigate the likelihood that physical, emotional, |
|or mental harm will result, and include, but are not limited |
|to:|
|||||(1) the news media outlet's willingness to take steps |
|to protect the minor's privacy, such as using a pseudonym |
|or limiting the use of the voice or image of a minor;|
|||||(2) the presence of the minor's guardian ad litem or |
|attorney or another adult of the minor's choosing, during |
|the communication with the news media; and|
|||||(3) providing the minor with age-appropriate media |
|literacy materials or other relevant educational material.|||

|adjudged a ward of the court and may pray generally for relief |
|available under this Act. The petition need not specify any |

|Protection. |||
|||(4) If termination of parental rights and appointment of a |

|relief shall clearly and obviously state that the parents |

|||In addition to the foregoing, the petitioner, by motion, |
|may request the termination of parental rights and appointment |
|of a guardian of the person with power to consent to adoption |

|a dispositional order under Section 2-22.|||
|||(4.5) (a) Unless good cause exists that filing a petition |
|to terminate parental rights is contrary to the child's best |

|pursuant to this Act, the Department of Children and Family |
|Services shall request the State's Attorney to file a petition |
|or motion for termination of parental rights and appointment |
|of guardian of the person with power to consent to adoption of |
|the minor under Section 2-29 if:|||

|||||(i) a minor has been in foster care, as described in |

|previously determined to be abandoned at an adjudicatory |

|to any of the foregoing offenses. |||
|||(a-1) For purposes of this subsection (4.5), good cause |
|exists in the following circumstances: |

|||||(ii) the Department has documented in the case plan a |
|compelling reason for determining that filing such |
|petition would not be in the best interests of the child,|||

|||||(iv) the parent is incarcerated, or the parent's prior |
|incarceration is a significant factor in why the child has |
|been in foster care for 15 months out of any 22-month |
|period, the parent maintains a meaningful role in the |
|child's life, and the Department has not documented |
|another reason why it would otherwise be appropriate to |
|file a petition to terminate parental rights pursuant to |
|this Section and the Adoption Act. The assessment of |
|whether an incarcerated parent maintains a meaningful role |
|in the child's life may include consideration of the |
|following:|||
|||||||(A) the child's best interest;|
|||||||(B) the parent's expressions or acts of |

|manifesting concern for the child, such as letters, |
|telephone calls, visits, and other forms of |

|work with the Department for the purpose of complying |
|with the service plan and repairing, maintaining, or |
|building the parent-child relationship; or|
|||||||(D) limitations in the parent's access to family |
|support programs, therapeutic services, visiting |
|opportunities, telephone and mail services, and |
|meaningful participation in court proceedings. |
|||(b) For purposes of this subsection, the date of entering |
|foster care is defined as the earlier of:|||
|||||(1) The date of a judicial finding at an adjudicatory |
|hearing that the child is an abused, neglected, or |
|dependent minor; or|||

|removed from |_|the child's|_|||his or her||parent, guardian, or |

|||(5) The court shall liberally allow the petitioner to |
|amend the petition to set forth a cause of action or to add, |
|amend, or supplement factual allegations that form the basis |
|for a cause of action up until 14 days before the adjudicatory |

|hearing. The petitioner may amend the petition after that date |
|and prior to the adjudicatory hearing if the court grants |
|leave to amend upon a showing of good cause. The court may |
|allow amendment of the petition to conform with the evidence |
|at any time prior to ruling. In all cases in which the court |
|has granted leave to amend based on new evidence or new |
|allegations, the court shall permit the respondent an adequate |
|opportunity to prepare a defense to the amended petition.|||
|||(6) At any time before dismissal of the petition or before |

|||(4) The summons may be served by any county sheriff, |
|coroner or probation officer, even though the officer is the |
|petitioner. The return of the summons with endorsement of |
|service by the officer is sufficient proof thereof.|||
|||(5) Service of a summons and petition shall be made by: (a) |
|leaving a copy thereof with the person summoned at least 3 days |
|before the time stated therein for appearance; (b) leaving a |

|copy at |_|the summoned person's|_|||his or her||usual place of abode |

|mail the summons and a copy of the petition to that respondent |
|by certified mail marked for delivery to addressee only. The |

|respondent's current and last known address. The Department of |
|Children and Family Services shall adopt rules defining the |
|requirements for conducting a diligent search to locate |
|parents of minors in the custody of the Department. If, after |
|diligent inquiry made at any time within the preceding 12 |
|months, the usual place of abode cannot be reasonably |
|ascertained, or if |_|the|_|respondent is concealing |_|the |_

|(i) orders requiring parties to cooperate with services, (ii) |
|restraining orders controlling the conduct of any party likely |

|of the planned placement change in writing no later than 10 |
|days prior to the implementation of its determination unless |

|Section 9.1 of the Children and Family Services Act.|||

|protection is sought may retain counsel to represent |_|the |_
_|person|_|||him||at a hearing, and has rights to be present at the |
|hearing, to be informed prior to the hearing in writing of the |

|protection is sought with written notice of the contents of |
|the petition seeking a protective order and of the date, place |
|and time at which the hearing on the petition is to be held. |
|When a protective order is being sought in conjunction with a |

|temporary custody hearing, if the court finds that the person |
|against whom the protective order is being sought has been |
|notified of the hearing or that diligent efforts have been |
|made to notify such person, the court may conduct a hearing. If |
|a protective order is sought at any time other than in |
|conjunction with a temporary custody hearing, the court may |
|not conduct a hearing on the petition in the absence of the |
|person against whom the order is sought unless the petitioner |
|has notified such person by personal service at least 3 days |
|before the hearing or has sent written notice by first class |

|committed to the Department of Children and Family |

|a minor under the age of 18 for whom an independent basis |
|of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists, or (iii) a minor |

|for care and service; however, a minor charged with a |

|Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not |
|be placed in the custody of or committed to the Department |
|of Children and Family Services by any court, except (i) a |

|whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency |

|to otherwise comply with Section 7 of the Children and Family |
|Services Act in placing the child. In addition, whenever |
|alternative plans for placement are available, the court shall |
|ascertain and consider, to the extent appropriate in the |

|||(2) When a minor is placed with a suitable relative or |
|other person pursuant to item (a) of subsection (1), the court |
|shall appoint |_|the suitable relative or other person|_|||him or her|||
|the legal custodian or guardian of the person of the minor. |
|When a minor is committed to any agency, the court shall |
|appoint the proper officer or representative thereof as legal |
|custodian or guardian of the person of the minor. Legal |
|custodians and guardians of the person of the minor have the |
|respective rights and duties set forth in subsection (9) of |
|Section 1-3 except as otherwise provided by order of court; |
|but no guardian of the person may consent to adoption of the |
|minor unless that authority is conferred upon |_|the guardian|_|||him |
|or her||in accordance with Section 2-29. An agency whose |
|representative is appointed guardian of the person or legal |
|custodian of the minor may place the minor in any child care |
|facility, but the facility must be licensed under the Child |
|Care Act of 1969 or have been approved by the Department of |
|Children and Family Services as meeting the standards |
|established for such licensing. No agency may place a minor |
|adjudicated under Sections 2-3 or 2-4 in a child care facility |
|unless the placement is in compliance with the rules and |
|regulations for placement under this Section promulgated by |
|the Department of Children and Family Services under Section 5 |
|of the Children and Family Services Act. Like authority and |

|Section 2-31, or if the minor was previously committed to the |

|||(1) A minor under 18 years of age and who is subject under |
|Article II of this Act to a secure child care facility may be |

|admitted to a secure child care facility for inpatient |
|treatment upon application to the facility director if, prior |
|to admission, the facility director and the Director of the |
|Department of Children and Family Services or the Director's |
|designate find that: the minor has a mental illness or |
|emotional disturbance, including but not limited to a behavior |
|disorder, of such severity that placement in a secure child |
|care facility is necessary because in the absence of such a |
|placement, the minor is likely to endanger self or others or |
|not meet |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||basic needs and this placement |
|is the least restrictive alternative. Prior to admission, a |
|psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or clinical psychologist |
|who has personally examined the minor shall state in writing |
|that the minor meets the standards for admission. The |
|statement must set forth in detail the reasons for that |
|conclusion and shall indicate what alternatives to secure |
|treatment have been explored. When the minor is placed in a |
|child care facility which includes a secure child care |
|facility in addition to a less restrictive setting, and the |
|application for admission states that the minor will be |
|permanently placed in the less restrictive setting of the |
|child care facility as part of |_|the minor's|_|||his or her|||
|permanency plan after the need for secure treatment has ended, |
|the psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or clinical |
|psychologist shall state the reasons for the minor's need to |
|be placed in secure treatment, the conditions under which the |

|minor may be placed in the less restrictive setting of the |
|facility, and the conditions under which the minor may need to |
|be returned to secure treatment.|||
|||(2) The application for admission under this Section shall |
|contain, in large bold-face type, a statement written in |
|simple non-technical terms of the minor's right to object and |
|the right to a hearing. A minor 12 years of age or older must |
|be given a copy of the application and the statement should be |
|explained to |_|the minor|_|||him or her||in an understandable manner. |
|A copy of the application shall also be given to the person who |
|executed it, the designate of the Director of the Department |
|of Children and Family Services, the minor's parent, the |
|minor's attorney, and, if the minor is 12 years of age or |
|older, 2 other persons whom the minor may designate, excluding |
|persons whose whereabouts cannot reasonably be ascertained.|||
|||(3) Thirty days after admission, the facility director |
|shall review the minor's record and assess the need for |
|continuing placement in a secure child care facility. When the |
|minor has been placed in a child care facility which includes a |
|secure child care facility in addition to a less restrictive |
|setting, and the application for admission states that the |
|minor will be permanently placed in the less restrictive |
|setting of the child care facility as part of |_|the minor's|_|||his |
|or her||permanency plan after the need for secure treatment has |
|ended, the facility director shall review the stated reasons |
|for the minor's need to be placed in secure treatment, the |

|conditions under which the minor may be placed in the less |
|restrictive setting of the facility, and the conditions under |
|which the minor may need to be returned to secure treatment. |
|The director of the facility shall consult with the designate |
|of the Director of the Department of Children and Family |
|Services and request authorization for continuing placement of |
|the minor. Request and authorization should be noted in the |
|minor's record. Every 60 days thereafter a review shall be |
|conducted and new authorization shall be secured from the |
|designate for as long as placement continues. Failure or |
|refusal to authorize continued placement shall constitute a |
|request for the minor's discharge.|||
|||(4) At any time during a minor's placement in a secure |
|child care facility, an objection may be made to that |
|placement by the minor, the minor's parents (except where |
|parental rights have been terminated), the minor's guardian ad |
|litem, or the minor's attorney. When an objection is made, the |
|minor shall be discharged at the earliest appropriate time not |
|to exceed 15 days, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays |
|unless the objection is withdrawn in writing or unless, within |
|that time, the Director or |_|the Director's|_|||his or her||designate |
|files with the Court a petition for review of the admission. |
|The petition must be accompanied by a certificate signed by a |
|psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or clinical |
|psychologist. The certificate shall be based upon a personal |
|examination and shall specify that the minor has a mental |

|illness or an emotional disturbance of such severity that |
|placement in a secure facility is necessary, that the minor |
|can benefit from the placement, that a less restrictive |
|alternative is not appropriate, and that the placement is in |
|the minor's best interest.|||
|||(5) Upon receipt of a petition, the court shall set a |
|hearing to be held within 5 days, excluding Saturdays, |
|Sundays, and holidays. The court shall direct that notice of |
|the time and place of the hearing shall be served upon the |
|minor, |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||attorney and the minor's |
|guardian ad litem, the Director of the Department of Children |
|and Family Services or |_|the Director's|_|||his or her||designate, |
|the State's Attorney, and the attorney for the parents.|||
|||(6) The court shall order the minor discharged from the |
|secure child care facility if it determines that the minor |
|does not have a mental illness or emotional disturbance of |
|such severity that placement in a secure facility is |
|necessary, or if it determines that a less restrictive |
|alternative is appropriate.|||
|||(7) If however, the court finds that the minor does have a |
|mental illness or an emotional disturbance for which the minor |
|is likely to benefit from treatment but that a less |
|restrictive alternative is appropriate, the court shall order |
|that the Department of Children and Family Services prepare a |
|case plan for the minor which permits alternative treatment |
|which is capable of providing adequate and humane treatment in |

|the least restrictive setting that is appropriate to the |
|minor's condition and serves the minor's best interests, and |
|shall authorize the continued placement of the minor in the |
|secure child care facility. At each permanency hearing |
|conducted thereafter, the court shall determine whether the |
|minor does not have a mental illness or emotional disturbance |
|of such severity that placement in a secure facility is |
|necessary or, if a less restrictive alternative is |
|appropriate. If either of these 2 conditions are not met, the |
|court shall order the minor discharged from the secure child |
|care facility.|||
|||(8) Unwillingness or inability of the Department of |
|Children and Family Services to find a placement for the minor |
|shall not be grounds for the court's refusing to order |
|discharge of the minor.|||

|safety and it is in the best interests of the minor, and if |
|such neglect, abuse, or dependency is found by the court under |
|paragraph (1) of Section 2-21 of this Act to have come about |
|due to the acts or omissions or both of such parent, guardian, |
|or legal custodian, until such time as an investigation is |
|made as provided in paragraph (5) and a hearing is held on the |
|issue of the fitness of such parent, guardian, or legal |
|custodian to care for the minor and the court enters an order |
|that such parent, guardian, or legal custodian is fit to care |
|for the minor.|||
|||(1.5) The public agency that is the custodian or guardian |
|of the minor shall file a written report with the court no |

|later than 15 days after a minor in the agency's care remains:|
|||||(1) in a shelter placement beyond 30 days;|
|||||(2) in a psychiatric hospital past the time when the |
|minor is clinically ready for discharge or beyond medical |
|necessity for the minor's health; or|
|||||(3) in a detention center or Department of Juvenile |
|Justice facility solely because the public agency cannot |
|find an appropriate placement for the minor.|
|||The report shall explain the steps the agency is taking to |
|ensure the minor is placed appropriately, how the minor's |
|needs are being met in the minor's shelter placement, and if a |
|future placement has been identified by the Department, why |
|the anticipated placement is appropriate for the needs of the |
|minor and the anticipated placement date. |
|||(1.6) Within 35 days after placing a child in its care in a |
|qualified residential treatment program, as defined by the |
|federal Social Security Act, the Department of Children and |
|Family Services shall file a written report with the court and |
|send copies of the report to all parties. Within 20 days of the |
|filing of the report, the court shall hold a hearing to |
|consider the Department's report and determine whether |
|placement of the child in a qualified residential treatment |
|program provides the most effective and appropriate level of |
|care for the child in the least restrictive environment and if |
|the placement is consistent with the short-term and long-term |
|goals for the child, as specified in the permanency plan for |

|the child. The court shall approve or disapprove the |
|placement. If applicable, the requirements of Sections 2-27.1 |
|and 2-27.2 must also be met. The Department's written report |
|and the court's written determination shall be included in and |
|made part of the case plan for the child. If the child remains |
|placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the |
|Department shall submit evidence at each status and permanency |
|hearing: |
|||||(1) demonstrating that on-going assessment of the |
|strengths and needs of the child continues to support the |
|determination that the child's needs cannot be met through |
|placement in a foster family home, that the placement |
|provides the most effective and appropriate level of care |
|for the child in the least restrictive, appropriate |
|environment, and that the placement is consistent with the |
|short-term and long-term permanency goal for the child, as |
|specified in the permanency plan for the child; |
|||||(2) documenting the specific treatment or service |
|needs that should be met for the child in the placement and |
|the length of time the child is expected to need the |
|treatment or services; and |
|||||(3) the efforts made by the agency to prepare the |
|child to return home or to be placed with a fit and willing |
|relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a |
|foster family home. |
|||(2) The first permanency hearing shall be conducted by the |

|judge. Subsequent permanency hearings may be heard by a judge |
|or by hearing officers appointed or approved by the court in |
|the manner set forth in Section 2-28.1 of this Act. The initial |
|hearing shall be held (a) within 12 months from the date |
|temporary custody was taken, regardless of whether an |
|adjudication or dispositional hearing has been completed |
|within that time frame, (b) if the parental rights of both |
|parents have been terminated in accordance with the procedure |
|described in subsection (5) of Section 2-21, within 30 days of |
|the order for termination of parental rights and appointment |
|of a guardian with power to consent to adoption, or (c) in |
|accordance with subsection (2) of Section 2-13.1. Subsequent |
|permanency hearings shall be held every 6 months or more |
|frequently if necessary in the court's determination following |
|the initial permanency hearing, in accordance with the |
|standards set forth in this Section, until the court |
|determines that the plan and goal have been achieved. Once the |
|plan and goal have been achieved, if the minor remains in |
|substitute care, the case shall be reviewed at least every 6 |
|months thereafter, subject to the provisions of this Section, |
|unless the minor is placed in the guardianship of a suitable |
|relative or other person and the court determines that further |
|monitoring by the court does not further the health, safety|_|,|_||
|or best interest of the child and that this is a stable |
|permanent placement. The permanency hearings must occur within |
|the time frames set forth in this subsection and may not be |

|delayed in anticipation of a report from any source or due to |
|the agency's failure to timely file its written report (this |
|written report means the one required under the next paragraph |
|and does not mean the service plan also referred to in that |
|paragraph).|||
|||The public agency that is the custodian or guardian of the |
|minor, or another agency responsible for the minor's care, |
|shall ensure that all parties to the permanency hearings are |
|provided a copy of the most recent service plan prepared |
|within the prior 6 months at least 14 days in advance of the |
|hearing. If not contained in the agency's service plan, the |
|agency shall also include a report setting forth (i) any |
|special physical, psychological, educational, medical, |
|emotional, or other needs of the minor or |_|the minor's|_|||his or |
|her||family that are relevant to a permanency or placement |
|determination and (ii) for any minor age 16 or over, a written |
|description of the programs and services that will enable the |
|minor to prepare for independent living. If not contained in |
|the agency's service plan, the agency's report shall specify |
|if a minor is placed in a licensed child care facility under a |
|corrective plan by the Department due to concerns impacting |
|the minor's safety and well-being. The report shall explain |
|the steps the Department is taking to ensure the safety and |
|well-being of the minor and that the minor's needs are met in |
|the facility. The agency's written report must detail what |
|progress or lack of progress the parent has made in correcting |

|the conditions requiring the child to be in care; whether the |
|child can be returned home without jeopardizing the child's |
|health, safety, and welfare, and if not, what permanency goal |
|is recommended to be in the best interests of the child, and |
|why the other permanency goals are not appropriate. The |
|caseworker must appear and testify at the permanency hearing. |
|If a permanency hearing has not previously been scheduled by |
|the court, the moving party shall move for the setting of a |
|permanency hearing and the entry of an order within the time |
|frames set forth in this subsection.|||
|||At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine the |
|future status of the child. The court shall set one of the |
|following permanency goals:|||
|||||(A) The minor will be returned home by a specific date |
|within 5 months.|||
|||||(B) The minor will be in short-term care with a |
|continued goal to return home within a period not to |
|exceed one year, where the progress of the parent or |
|parents is substantial giving particular consideration to |
|the age and individual needs of the minor.|||
|||||(B-1) The minor will be in short-term care with a |
|continued goal to return home pending a status hearing. |
|When the court finds that a parent has not made reasonable |
|efforts or reasonable progress to date, the court shall |
|identify what actions the parent and the Department must |
|take in order to justify a finding of reasonable efforts |

|or reasonable progress and shall set a status hearing to |
|be held not earlier than 9 months from the date of |
|adjudication nor later than 11 months from the date of |
|adjudication during which the parent's progress will again |
|be reviewed.|||
|||||(C) The minor will be in substitute care pending court |
|determination on termination of parental rights.|||
|||||(D) Adoption, provided that parental rights have been |
|terminated or relinquished.|||
|||||(E) The guardianship of the minor will be transferred |
|to an individual or couple on a permanent basis provided |
|that goals (A) through (D) have been deemed inappropriate |
|and not in the child's best interests. The court shall |
|confirm that the Department has discussed adoption, if |
|appropriate, and guardianship with the caregiver prior to |
|changing a goal to guardianship.|||
|||||(F) The minor over age 15 will be in substitute care |
|pending independence. In selecting this permanency goal, |
|the Department of Children and Family Services may provide |
|services to enable reunification and to strengthen the |
|minor's connections with family, fictive kin, and other |
|responsible adults, provided the services are in the |
|minor's best interest. The services shall be documented in |
|the service plan. |||
|||||(G) The minor will be in substitute care because |_|the |_
_|minor|_|||he or she||cannot be provided for in a home |

|environment due to developmental disabilities or mental |
|illness or because |_|the minor|_|||he or she||is a danger to self |
|or others, provided that goals (A) through (D) have been |
|deemed inappropriate and not in the child's best |
|interests.|||
|||In selecting any permanency goal, the court shall indicate |
|in writing the reasons the goal was selected and why the |
|preceding goals were deemed inappropriate and not in the |
|child's best interest. Where the court has selected a |
|permanency goal other than (A), (B), or (B-1), the Department |
|of Children and Family Services shall not provide further |
|reunification services, except as provided in paragraph (F) of |
|this subsection (2), but shall provide services consistent |
|with the goal selected.|||
|||||(H) Notwithstanding any other provision in this |
|Section, the court may select the goal of continuing |
|foster care as a permanency goal if: |
|||||||(1) The Department of Children and Family Services |
|has custody and guardianship of the minor; |
|||||||(2) The court has deemed all other permanency |
|goals inappropriate based on the child's best |
|interest; |
|||||||(3) The court has found compelling reasons, based |
|on written documentation reviewed by the court, to |
|place the minor in continuing foster care. Compelling |
|reasons include: |

|||||||||(a) the child does not wish to be adopted or to |
|be placed in the guardianship of |_|the minor's|_|||his |
|or her||relative or foster care placement; |
|||||||||(b) the child exhibits an extreme level of |
|need such that the removal of the child from |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his or her||placement would be detrimental |
|to the child; or |
|||||||||(c) the child who is the subject of the |
|permanency hearing has existing close and strong |
|bonds with a sibling, and achievement of another |
|permanency goal would substantially interfere with |
|the subject child's sibling relationship, taking |
|into consideration the nature and extent of the |
|relationship, and whether ongoing contact is in |
|the subject child's best interest, including |
|long-term emotional interest, as compared with the |
|legal and emotional benefit of permanence; |
|||||||(4) The child has lived with the relative or |
|foster parent for at least one year; and |
|||||||(5) The relative or foster parent currently caring |
|for the child is willing and capable of providing the |
|child with a stable and permanent environment. |
|||The court shall set a permanency goal that is in the best |
|interest of the child. In determining that goal, the court |
|shall consult with the minor in an age-appropriate manner |
|regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan for the |

|minor. The court's determination shall include the following |
|factors:|||
|||||(1) Age of the child.|||
|||||(2) Options available for permanence, including both |
|out-of-state and in-state placement options.|||
|||||(3) Current placement of the child and the intent of |
|the family regarding adoption.|||
|||||(4) Emotional, physical, and mental status or |
|condition of the child.|||
|||||(5) Types of services previously offered and whether |
|or not the services were successful and, if not |
|successful, the reasons the services failed.|||
|||||(6) Availability of services currently needed and |
|whether the services exist.|||
|||||(7) Status of siblings of the minor.|||
|||The court shall consider (i) the permanency goal contained |
|in the service plan, (ii) the appropriateness of the services |
|contained in the plan and whether those services have been |
|provided, (iii) whether reasonable efforts have been made by |
|all the parties to the service plan to achieve the goal, and |
|(iv) whether the plan and goal have been achieved. All |
|evidence relevant to determining these questions, including |
|oral and written reports, may be admitted and may be relied on |
|to the extent of their probative value.|||
|||The court shall make findings as to whether, in violation |
|of Section 8.2 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting |

|Act, any portion of the service plan compels a child or parent |
|to engage in any activity or refrain from any activity that is |
|not reasonably related to remedying a condition or conditions |
|that gave rise or which could give rise to any finding of child |
|abuse or neglect. The services contained in the service plan |
|shall include services reasonably related to remedy the |
|conditions that gave rise to removal of the child from the home |
|of |_|the child's|_|||his or her||parents, guardian, or legal |
|custodian or that the court has found must be remedied prior to |
|returning the child home. Any tasks the court requires of the |
|parents, guardian, or legal custodian or child prior to |
|returning the child home||,||must be reasonably related to |
|remedying a condition or conditions that gave rise to or which |
|could give rise to any finding of child abuse or neglect. |
|||If the permanency goal is to return home, the court shall |
|make findings that identify any problems that are causing |
|continued placement of the children away from the home and |
|identify what outcomes would be considered a resolution to |
|these problems. The court shall explain to the parents that |
|these findings are based on the information that the court has |
|at that time and may be revised, should additional evidence be |
|presented to the court. |
|||The court shall review the Sibling Contact Support Plan |
|developed or modified under subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of |
|the Children and Family Services Act, if applicable. If the |
|Department has not convened a meeting to develop or modify a |

|Sibling Contact Support Plan, or if the court finds that the |
|existing Plan is not in the child's best interest, the court |
|may enter an order requiring the Department to develop, |
|modify|_|,|_|or implement a Sibling Contact Support Plan, or order |
|mediation. |
|||If the goal has been achieved, the court shall enter |
|orders that are necessary to conform the minor's legal custody |
|and status to those findings.|||
|||If, after receiving evidence, the court determines that |
|the services contained in the plan are not reasonably |
|calculated to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, |
|the court shall put in writing the factual basis supporting |
|the determination and enter specific findings based on the |
|evidence. The court also shall enter an order for the |
|Department to develop and implement a new service plan or to |
|implement changes to the current service plan consistent with |
|the court's findings. The new service plan shall be filed with |
|the court and served on all parties within 45 days of the date |
|of the order. The court shall continue the matter until the new |
|service plan is filed. Except as authorized by subsection |
|(2.5) of this Section and as otherwise specifically authorized |
|by law, the court is not empowered under this Section to order |
|specific placements, specific services, or specific service |
|providers to be included in the service plan.|||
|||A guardian or custodian appointed by the court pursuant to |
|this Act shall file updated case plans with the court every 6 |

|months.|||
|||Rights of wards of the court under this Act are |
|enforceable against any public agency by complaints for relief |
|by mandamus filed in any proceedings brought under this Act.|||
|||(2.5) If, after reviewing the evidence, including evidence |
|from the Department, the court determines that the minor's |
|current or planned placement is not necessary or appropriate |
|to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court |
|shall put in writing the factual basis supporting its |
|determination and enter specific findings based on the |
|evidence. If the court finds that the minor's current or |
|planned placement is not necessary or appropriate, the court |
|may enter an order directing the Department to implement a |
|recommendation by the minor's treating clinician or a |
|clinician contracted by the Department to evaluate the minor |
|or a recommendation made by the Department. If the Department |
|places a minor in a placement under an order entered under this |
|subsection (2.5), the Department has the authority to remove |
|the minor from that placement when a change in circumstances |
|necessitates the removal to protect the minor's health, |
|safety, and best interest. If the Department determines |
|removal is necessary, the Department shall notify the parties |
|of the planned placement change in writing no later than 10 |
|days prior to the implementation of its determination unless |
|remaining in the placement poses an imminent risk of harm to |
|the minor, in which case the Department shall notify the |

|parties of the placement change in writing immediately |
|following the implementation of its decision. The Department |
|shall notify others of the decision to change the minor's |
|placement as required by Department rule. |
|||(3) Following the permanency hearing, the court shall |
|enter a written order that includes the determinations |
|required under subsection (2) of this Section and sets forth |
|the following:|||
|||||(a) The future status of the minor, including the |
|permanency goal, and any order necessary to conform the |
|minor's legal custody and status to such determination; or|||
|||||(b) If the permanency goal of the minor cannot be |
|achieved immediately, the specific reasons for continuing |
|the minor in the care of the Department of Children and |
|Family Services or other agency for |_|short-term|_|||short term|||
|placement, and the following determinations:|||
|||||||(i) (Blank).|||
|||||||(ii) Whether the services required by the court |
|and by any service plan prepared within the prior 6 |
|months have been provided and (A) if so, whether the |
|services were reasonably calculated to facilitate the |
|achievement of the permanency goal or (B) if not |
|provided, why the services were not provided.|||
|||||||(iii) Whether the minor's current or planned |
|placement is necessary, and appropriate to the plan |
|and goal, recognizing the right of minors to the least |

|restrictive (most family-like) setting available and |
|in close proximity to the parents' home consistent |
|with the health, safety, best interest|_|,|_|and special |
|needs of the minor and, if the minor is placed |
|out-of-state, whether the out-of-state placement |
|continues to be appropriate and consistent with the |
|health, safety, and best interest of the minor.|||
|||||||(iv) (Blank).|||
|||||||(v) (Blank).|||
|||(4) The minor or any person interested in the minor may |
|apply to the court for a change in custody of the minor and the |
|appointment of a new custodian or guardian of the person or for |
|the restoration of the minor to the custody of |_|the minor's|_|||his|||
|parents or former guardian or custodian.|||
|||When return home is not selected as the permanency goal:|||
|||||(a) The Department, the minor, or the current foster |
|parent or relative caregiver seeking private guardianship |
|may file a motion for private guardianship of the minor. |
|Appointment of a guardian under this Section requires |
|approval of the court.|||
|||||(b) The State's Attorney may file a motion to |
|terminate parental rights of any parent who has failed to |
|make reasonable efforts to correct the conditions which |
|led to the removal of the child or reasonable progress |
|toward the return of the child, as defined in subdivision |
|(D)(m) of Section 1 of the Adoption Act or for whom any |

|other unfitness ground for terminating parental rights as |
|defined in subdivision (D) of Section 1 of the Adoption |
|Act exists.|
|||||When parental rights have been terminated for a |
|minimum of 3 years and the child who is the subject of the |
|permanency hearing is 13 years old or older and is not |
|currently placed in a placement likely to achieve |
|permanency, the Department of Children and Family Services |
|shall make reasonable efforts to locate parents whose |
|rights have been terminated, except when the Court |
|determines that those efforts would be futile or |
|inconsistent with the subject child's best interests. The |
|Department of Children and Family Services shall assess |
|the appropriateness of the parent whose rights have been |
|terminated, and shall, as appropriate, foster and support |
|connections between the parent whose rights have been |
|terminated and the youth. The Department of Children and |
|Family Services shall document its determinations and |
|efforts to foster connections in the child's case plan. |||
|||Custody of the minor shall not be restored to any parent, |
|guardian, or legal custodian in any case in which the minor is |
|found to be neglected or abused under Section 2-3 or dependent |
|under Section 2-4 of this Act, unless the minor can be cared |
|for at home without endangering |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||health |
|or safety and it is in the best interest of the minor, and if |
|such neglect, abuse, or dependency is found by the court under |

|paragraph (1) of Section 2-21 of this Act to have come about |
|due to the acts or omissions or both of such parent, guardian, |
|or legal custodian, until such time as an investigation is |
|made as provided in paragraph (5) and a hearing is held on the |
|issue of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor and |
|the fitness of such parent, guardian, or legal custodian to |
|care for the minor and the court enters an order that such |
|parent, guardian, or legal custodian is fit to care for the |
|minor. If a motion is filed to modify or vacate a private |
|guardianship order and return the child to a parent, guardian, |
|or legal custodian, the court may order the Department of |
|Children and Family Services to assess the minor's current and |
|proposed living arrangements and to provide ongoing monitoring |
|of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor during |
|the pendency of the motion to assist the court in making that |
|determination. In the event that the minor has attained 18 |
|years of age and the guardian or custodian petitions the court |
|for an order terminating |_|the minor's|_|||his||guardianship or |
|custody, guardianship or custody shall terminate automatically |
|30 days after the receipt of the petition unless the court |
|orders otherwise. No legal custodian or guardian of the person |
|may be removed without |_|the legal custodian's or guardian's|_|||his|||
|consent until given notice and an opportunity to be heard by |
|the court.|||
|||When the court orders a child restored to the custody of |
|the parent or parents, the court shall order the parent or |

|parents to cooperate with the Department of Children and |
|Family Services and comply with the terms of an after-care |
|plan, or risk the loss of custody of the child and possible |
|termination of their parental rights. The court may also enter |
|an order of protective supervision in accordance with Section |
|2-24.|||
|||If the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, |
|legal custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, |
|and an Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the |
|court may order the Department of Children and Family Services |
|to arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living |
|arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, |
|and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of |
|protective supervision entered in accordance with Section |
|2-24. |
|||(5) Whenever a parent, guardian, or legal custodian files |
|a motion for restoration of custody of the minor, and the minor |
|was adjudicated neglected, abused, or dependent as a result of |
|physical abuse, the court shall cause to be made an |
|investigation as to whether the movant has ever been charged |
|with or convicted of any criminal offense which would indicate |
|the likelihood of any further physical abuse to the minor. |
|Evidence of such criminal convictions shall be taken into |
|account in determining whether the minor can be cared for at |
|home without endangering |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||health or |
|safety and fitness of the parent, guardian, or legal |

|custodian.|||
|||||(a) Any agency of this State or any subdivision |
|thereof shall cooperate with the agent of the court in |
|providing any information sought in the investigation.|||
|||||(b) The information derived from the investigation and |
|any conclusions or recommendations derived from the |
|information shall be provided to the parent, guardian, or |
|legal custodian seeking restoration of custody prior to |
|the hearing on fitness and the movant shall have an |
|opportunity at the hearing to refute the information or |
|contest its significance.|||

|||Sec. 2-29. ||Adoption; appointment of guardian with power to |
|consent. |||
|||(1) With leave of the court, a minor who is the subject of |
|an abuse, neglect, or dependency petition under this Act may |
|be the subject of a petition for adoption under the Adoption |
|Act.|||
|||(1.1) The parent or parents of a child in whose interest a |

|petition under Section 2-13 of this Act is pending may, in the |
|manner required by the Adoption Act, (a) surrender |_|the child|_||
|him or her||for adoption to an agency legally authorized or |
|licensed to place children for adoption, (b) consent to |_|the |_
_|child's|_|||his or her||adoption, or (c) consent to |_|the
child's|_|||his |
|or her||adoption by a specified person or persons. Nothing in |
|this Section requires that the parent or parents execute the |
|surrender, consent, or consent to adoption by a specified |
|person in open court.|||
|||(2) If a petition or motion alleges and the court finds |
|that it is in the best interest of the minor that parental |
|rights be terminated and the petition or motion requests that |
|a guardian of the person be appointed and authorized to |
|consent to the adoption of the minor, the court, with the |
|consent of the parents, if living, or after finding, based |
|upon clear and convincing evidence, that a parent is an unfit |
|person as defined in Section 1 of the Adoption Act, may |
|terminate parental rights and empower the guardian of the |
|person of the minor, in the order appointing |_|the guardian of |_
_|the person of the minor|_|||him or her||as such guardian, to appear |
|in court where any proceedings for the adoption of the minor |
|may at any time be pending and to consent to the adoption. Such |
|consent is sufficient to authorize the court in the adoption |
|proceedings to enter a proper order or judgment of adoption |
|without further notice to, or consent by, the parents of the |
|minor. An order so empowering the guardian to consent to |

|adoption deprives the parents of the minor of all legal rights |
|as respects the minor and relieves them of all parental |
|responsibility for |_|the minor|_|||him or her||, and frees the minor |
|from all obligations of maintenance and obedience to |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his or her||natural parents.|||
|||If the minor is over 14 years of age, the court may, in its |
|discretion, consider the wishes of the minor in determining |
|whether the best interests of the minor would be promoted by |
|the finding of the unfitness of a non-consenting parent.|||
|||(2.1) Notice to a parent who has appeared or been served |
|with summons personally or by certified mail, and for whom an |
|order of default has been entered on the petition for wardship |
|and has not been set aside shall be provided in accordance with |
|Supreme Court Rule 11. Notice to a parent who was served by |
|publication and for whom an order of default has been entered |
|on the petition for wardship and has not been set aside shall |
|be provided in accordance with Sections 2-15 and 2-16.|||
|||(3) Parental consent to the order terminating parental |
|rights and authorizing the guardian of the person to consent |
|to adoption of the minor must be in writing and signed in the |
|form provided in the Adoption Act, but no names of petitioners |
|for adoption need be included.|||
|||(4) A finding of the unfitness of a parent must be made in |
|compliance with the Adoption Act, without regard to the |

|||Sec. 2-31. ||Duration of wardship and discharge of |
|proceedings. |||
|||(1) All proceedings under Article II of this Act in |
|respect of any minor automatically terminate upon |_|the minor|_||
|his or her||attaining the age of 21 years. |||
|||(2) Whenever the court determines, and makes written |
|factual findings, that health, safety, and the best interests |
|of the minor and the public no longer require the wardship of |
|the court, the court shall order the wardship terminated and |
|all proceedings under this Act respecting that minor finally |
|closed and discharged. The court may at the same time continue |
|or terminate any custodianship or guardianship theretofore |
|ordered but the termination must be made in compliance with |
|Section 2-28. When terminating wardship under this Section, if |
|the minor is over 18 or if wardship is terminated in |
|conjunction with an order partially or completely emancipating |
|the minor in accordance with the Emancipation of Minors Act, |

|the court shall also consider the following factors, in |
|addition to the health, safety, and best interest of the minor |
|and the public: (A) the minor's wishes regarding case closure; |
|(B) the manner in which the minor will maintain independence |
|without services from the Department; (C) the minor's |
|engagement in services including placement offered by the |
|Department; (D) if the minor is not engaged, the Department's |
|efforts to engage the minor; (E) the nature of communication |
|between the minor and the Department; (F) the minor's |
|involvement in other State systems or services; (G) the |
|minor's connections with family and other community support; |
|and (H) any other factor the court deems relevant. The minor's |
|lack of cooperation with services provided by the Department |
|of Children and Family Services shall not by itself be |
|considered sufficient evidence that the minor is prepared to |
|live independently and that it is in the best interest of the |
|minor to terminate wardship. It shall not be in the minor's |
|best interest to terminate wardship of a minor over the age of |
|18 who is in the guardianship of the Department of Children and |
|Family Services if the Department has not made reasonable |
|efforts to ensure that the minor has documents necessary for |
|adult living as provided in Section 35.10 of the Children and |
|Family Services Act. |||
|||(3) The wardship of the minor and any custodianship or |
|guardianship respecting the minor for whom a petition was |
|filed after July 24, 1991 (the effective date of Public Act |

|87-14) automatically terminates when |_|the minor|_|||he||attains the |
|age of 19 years, except as set forth in subsection (1) of this |
|Section. The clerk of the court shall at that time record all |
|proceedings under this Act as finally closed and discharged |
|for that reason. The provisions of this subsection (3) become |
|inoperative on and after July 12, 2019 (the effective date of |
|Public Act 101-78). |||

|the changes made by Public Act 101-78 apply to all cases that |
|are pending on or after July 12, 2019 (the effective date of |

|||Sec. 2-34. ||Motion to reinstate parental rights.|
|||(1) For purposes of this subsection (1), the term "parent" |
|refers to the person or persons whose rights were terminated |
|as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection; and the term |
|"minor" means a person under the age of 21 years subject to |
|this Act for whom the Department of Children and Family |
|Services Guardianship Administrator is appointed the temporary |
|custodian or guardian.|
|||A motion to reinstate parental rights may be filed only by |
|the Department of Children and Family Services or the minor |
|regarding any minor who is presently a ward of the court under |
|Article II of this Act when all the conditions set out in |

|paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this |
|subsection (1) are met:|
|||||(a) while the minor was under the jurisdiction of the |
|court under Article II of this Act, the minor's parent or |
|parents surrendered the minor for adoption to an agency |
|legally authorized to place children for adoption, or the |
|minor's parent or parents consented to |_|the minor's|_|||his or |
|her||adoption, or the minor's parent or parents consented |
|to |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||adoption by a specified person or |
|persons, or the parent or parents' rights were terminated |
|pursuant to a finding of unfitness pursuant to Section |
|2-29 of this Act and a guardian was appointed with the |
|power to consent to adoption pursuant to Section 2-29 of |
|this Act; and|
|||||(b) (i) since the signing of the surrender, the |
|signing of the consent, or the unfitness finding, the |
|minor has remained a ward of the Court under Article II of |
|this Act; or|
|||||(ii) the minor was made a ward of the Court, the minor |
|was placed in the private guardianship of an individual or |
|individuals, and after the appointment of a private |
|guardian and a new petition alleging abuse, neglect, or |
|dependency pursuant to Section 2-3 or 2-4 is filed, and |
|the minor is again found by the court to be abused, |
|neglected or dependent; or a supplemental petition to |
|reinstate wardship is filed pursuant to Section 2-33, and |

|the court reinstates wardship; or|
|||||(iii) the minor was made a ward of the Court, wardship |
|was terminated after the minor was adopted, after the |
|adoption a new petition alleging abuse, neglect, or |
|dependency pursuant to Section 2-3 or 2-4 is filed, and |
|the minor is again found by the court to be abused, |
|neglected, or dependent, and either (i) the adoptive |
|parent or parents are deceased, (ii) the adoptive parent |
|or parents signed a surrender of parental rights, or (iii) |
|the parental rights of the adoptive parent or parents were |
|terminated;|
|||||(c) the minor is not currently in a placement likely |
|to achieve permanency;|
|||||(d) it is in the minor's best interest that parental |
|rights be reinstated;|
|||||(e) the parent named in the motion wishes parental |
|rights to be reinstated and is currently appropriate to |
|have rights reinstated;|
|||||(f) more than 3 years have lapsed since the signing of |
|the consent or surrender, or the entry of the order |
|appointing a guardian with the power to consent to |
|adoption;|
|||||(g) (i) the child is 13 years of age or older or (ii) |
|the child is the younger sibling of such child, 13 years of |
|age or older, for whom reinstatement of parental rights is |
|being sought and the younger sibling independently meets |

|the criteria set forth in paragraphs (a) through (h) of |
|this subsection; and|
|||||(h) if the court has previously denied a motion to |
|reinstate parental rights filed by the Department, there |
|has been a substantial change in circumstances following |
|the denial of the earlier motion.|
|||(2) The motion may be filed only by the Department of |
|Children and Family Services or by the minor. Unless excused |
|by the court for good cause shown, the movant shall give notice |
|of the time and place of the hearing on the motion, in person |
|or by mail, to the parties to the juvenile court proceeding. |
|Notice shall be provided at least 14 days in advance of the |
|hearing date. The motion shall include the allegations |
|required in subsection (1) of this Section.|
|||(3) Any party may file a motion to dismiss the motion with |
|prejudice on the basis that the parent has intentionally acted |
|to prevent the child from being adopted, after parental rights |
|were terminated or the parent intentionally acted to disrupt |
|the child's adoption. If the court finds by a preponderance of |
|the evidence that the parent has intentionally acted to |
|prevent the child from being adopted, after parental rights |
|were terminated or that the parent intentionally acted to |
|disrupt the child's adoption, the court shall dismiss the |
|petition with prejudice. |
|||(4) The court shall not grant a motion for reinstatement |
|of parental rights unless the court finds that the motion is |

|supported by clear and convincing evidence. In ruling on a |
|motion to reinstate parental rights, the court shall make |
|findings consistent with the requirements in subsection (1) of |
|this Section. The court shall consider the reasons why the |
|child was initially brought to the attention of the court, the |
|history of the child's case as it relates to the parent seeking |
|reinstatement, and the current circumstances of the parent for |
|whom reinstatement of rights is sought. If reinstatement is |
|being considered subsequent to a finding of unfitness pursuant |
|to Section 2-29 of this Act having been entered with respect to |
|the parent whose rights are being restored, the court in |
|determining the minor's best interest shall consider, in |
|addition to the factors set forth in paragraph (4.05) of |
|Section 1-3 of this Act, the specific grounds upon which the |
|unfitness findings were made. Upon the entry of an order |
|granting a motion to reinstate parental rights, parental |
|rights of the parent named in the order shall be reinstated, |
|any previous order appointing a guardian with the power to |
|consent to adoption shall be void and with respect to the |
|parent named in the order, any consent shall be void.|
|||(5) If the case is post-disposition, the court, upon the |
|entry of an order granting a motion to reinstate parental |
|rights, shall schedule the matter for a permanency hearing |
|pursuant to Section 2-28 of this Act within 45 days.|
|||(6) Custody of the minor shall not be restored to the |
|parent, except by order of court pursuant to subsection (4) of |

|Section 2-28 of this Act.|
|||(7) In any case involving a child over the age of 13 who |
|meets the criteria established in this Section for |
|reinstatement of parental rights, the Department of Children |
|and Family Services shall conduct an assessment of the child's |
|circumstances to assist in future planning for the child, |
|including, but not limited to a determination regarding the |
|appropriateness of filing a motion to reinstate parental |
|rights.|

|of the minor's parent, guardian or custodian, or (ii) beyond |
|the control of |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||parent, guardian or |

|and where the minor is being kept.|||
|||(c) If the minor consents, the law enforcement officer |
|shall make a reasonable effort to transport, arrange for the |

|where the minor is being kept, and (iii) if the minor consents, |
|make a reasonable effort to transport, arrange for the |
|transportation of, or otherwise release the minor to the |
|parent, guardian or custodian. Upon release of the child who |
|is believed to need or benefit from medical, psychological, |

|inform the minor and the person to whom the minor is released |

|minor to be sheltered in a temporary living arrangement |
|provided the agency seeks to effect the minor's return home or |
|alternative living arrangements agreeable to the minor and the |

|shall be sheltered in a temporary living arrangement for more |
|than 48 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and |
|court-designated holidays, when the agency has reported the |
|minor as neglected or abused because the parent, guardian, or |
|custodian refuses to permit the child to return home, provided |
|that in all other instances the minor may be sheltered when the |
|agency obtains the consent of the parent, guardian, or |
|custodian or documents its unsuccessful efforts to obtain the |
|consent or authority of the parent, guardian, or custodian, |
|including recording the date and the staff involved in all |
|telephone calls, telegrams, letters, and personal contacts to |
|obtain the consent or authority, in which instances the minor |
|may be so sheltered for not more than 21 days. If the parent, |
|guardian or custodian refuses to permit the minor to return |
|home, and no other living arrangement agreeable to the parent, |
|guardian, or custodian can be made, and the parent, guardian, |
|or custodian has not made any other appropriate living |
|arrangement for the child, the agency may deem the minor to be |
|neglected and report the neglect to the Department of Children |

|and Family Services as provided in the Abused and Neglected |
|Child Reporting Act. The Child Protective Service Unit of the |
|Department of Children and Family Services shall begin an |
|investigation of the report within 24 hours after receiving |
|the report and shall determine whether to file a petition |
|alleging that the minor is neglected or abused as described in |
|Section 2-3 of this Act. Subject to appropriation, the |
|Department may take the minor into temporary protective |
|custody at any time after receiving the report, provided that |
|the Department shall take temporary protective custody within |
|48 hours of receiving the report if its investigation is not |
|completed. If the Department of Children and Family Services |
|determines that the minor is not a neglected minor because the |
|minor is an immediate physical danger to |_|the minor|_|||himself, |
|herself,||or others living in the home, then the Department |
|shall take immediate steps to either secure the minor's |
|immediate admission to a mental health facility, arrange for |
|law enforcement authorities to take temporary custody of the |
|minor as a delinquent minor, or take other appropriate action |
|to assume protective custody in order to safeguard the minor |
|or others living in the home from immediate physical danger. |||

|petition to be filed as provided in Section 3-15 of this Act, |

|witnesses present shall be examined before the court in |
|relation to any matter connected with the allegations made in |
|the petition.|||

|believe that the minor is a person requiring authoritative |
|intervention, it shall release the minor and dismiss the |
|petition.|||
|||(2) If the court finds that there is probable cause to |
|believe that the minor is a person requiring authoritative |
|intervention, the minor, |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||parent, |
|guardian, custodian and other persons able to give relevant |
|testimony shall be examined before the court. After such |
|testimony, the court may enter an order that the minor shall be |
|released upon the request of a parent, guardian or custodian |
|if the parent, guardian or custodian appears to take custody. |
|"Custodian" includes the Department of Children and Family |
|Services, if it has been given custody of the child, or any |
|other agency of the State which has been given custody or |
|wardship of the child. The Court shall require documentation |
|by representatives of the Department of Children and Family |
|Services or the probation department as to the reasonable |
|efforts that were made to prevent or eliminate the necessity |

|of removal of the minor from |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||home, and |
|shall consider the testimony of any person as to those |
|reasonable efforts. If the court finds that it is a matter of |
|immediate and urgent necessity for the protection of the minor |
|or of the person or property of another that the minor be |
|placed in a shelter care facility, or that |_|the minor|_|||he or she|||
|is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, and further |
|finds that reasonable efforts have been made or good cause has |
|been shown why reasonable efforts cannot prevent or eliminate |
|the necessity of removal of the minor from |_|the minor's|_|||his or |
|her||home, the court may prescribe shelter care and order that |
|the minor be kept in a suitable place designated by the court |
|or in a shelter care facility designated by the Department of |
|Children and Family Services or a licensed child welfare |
|agency; otherwise it shall release the minor from custody. If |
|the court prescribes shelter care, then in placing the minor, |
|the Department or other agency shall, to the extent compatible |
|with the court's order, comply with Section 7 of the Children |
|and Family Services Act. If the minor is ordered placed in a |
|shelter care facility of the Department of Children and Family |
|Services or a licensed child welfare agency, the court shall, |
|upon request of the Department or other agency, appoint the |
|Department of Children and Family Services Guardianship |
|Administrator or other appropriate agency executive temporary |
|custodian of the minor and the court may enter such other |
|orders related to the temporary custody as it deems fit and |

|proper, including the provision of services to the minor or |
_|the minor's|_|||his||family to ameliorate the causes contributing |
|to the finding of probable cause or to the finding of the |
|existence of immediate and urgent necessity. Acceptance of |
|services shall not be considered an admission of any |
|allegation in a petition made pursuant to this Act, nor may a |
|referral of services be considered as evidence in any |
|proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where the issue is |
|whether the Department has made reasonable efforts to reunite |
|the family. In making its findings that reasonable efforts |
|have been made or that good cause has been shown why reasonable |
|efforts cannot prevent or eliminate the necessity of removal |
|of the minor from |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||home, the court shall |
|state in writing its findings concerning the nature of the |
|services that were offered or the efforts that were made to |
|prevent removal of the child and the apparent reasons that |
|such services or efforts could not prevent the need for |
|removal. The parents, guardian, custodian, temporary custodian |
|and minor shall each be furnished a copy of such written |
|findings. The temporary custodian shall maintain a copy of the |
|court order and written findings in the case record for the |
|child.|||
|||The order together with the court's findings of fact and |
|support thereof shall be entered of record in the court.|||
|||Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and |
|urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the |

|minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not |
|be returned to the parent, custodian or guardian until the |
|court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the |
|protection of the minor.|||
|||(3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor |
|described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the petitioner is |
|unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter |
|care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an |
|ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of |
|issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and |
|entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from |
|the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is |

|right to request a full rehearing on whether the State should |
|have temporary custody of ................. To request this |

|hearing.|||
|||||2. That you did not get adequate notice (explaining |
|how the notice was inadequate).|||
|||||3. Your signature.|||
|||||4. Signature must be notarized.|||
|||The rehearing should be scheduled within one day of your |
|filing this affidavit.|||
|||At the rehearing, your rights are the same as at the |
|initial shelter care hearing. The enclosed notice explains |
|those rights.|||
|||At the Shelter Care Hearing, children have the following |
|rights:|||

|||||1. To have a guardian ad litem appointed.|||
|||||2. To be declared competent as a witness and to |
|present testimony concerning:|||
|||||||a. Whether they are abused, neglected or |
|dependent.|||
|||||||b. Whether there is "immediate and urgent |
|necessity" to be removed from home.|||
|||||||c. Their best interests.|||
|||||3. To cross examine witnesses for other parties.|||
|||||4. To obtain an explanation of any proceedings and |
|orders of the court.|||
|||(4) If the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible |
|relative, or counsel of the minor did not have actual notice of |
|or was not present at the shelter care hearing, |_|the parent, |_
_|guardian, legal custodian, responsible relative, or counsel of |_
_|the minor|_|||he or she||may file an affidavit setting forth these |
|facts, and the clerk shall set the matter for rehearing not |
|later than 48 hours, excluding Sundays and legal holidays, |
|after the filing of the affidavit. At the rehearing, the court |
|shall proceed in the same manner as upon the original hearing.|||
|||(5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that |
|the minor taken into custody is a person described in |
|subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or |
|detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This |
|Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).|||
|||(6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a |

|jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners |
|in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept |
|separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept |
|in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant |
|to the criminal law.|||
|||(7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer |
|within the time period specified in Section 3-11, the minor |
|must immediately be released from custody.|||
|||(8) If neither the parent, guardian or custodian appears |
|within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon |
|request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the |
|clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later |
|than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons |
|directed to the parent, guardian or custodian to appear. At |
|the same time the probation department shall prepare a report |
|on the minor. If a parent, guardian or custodian does not |
|appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order |
|prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place |
|designated by the Department of Children and Family Services |
|or a licensed child welfare agency.|||
|||(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, |
|any interested party, including the State, the temporary |
|custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family |
|under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and |
|Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their |
|representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, |

|may file a motion to modify or vacate a temporary custody order |
|on any of the following grounds:|||
|||||(a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent |
|necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or|||
|||||(b) There is a material change in the circumstances of |
|the natural family from which the minor was removed; or|||
|||||(c) A person, including a parent, relative or legal |
|guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the |
|minor; or|||
|||||(d) Services provided by the Department of Children |
|and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other |
|service provider have been successful in eliminating the |
|need for temporary custody.|||
|||The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than |
|14 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court |
|modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not |
|vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that |
|appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of |
|the minor and |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||family.|||

|court's determination of the minor's physical incapacity for |

|diligence to obtain evidence material to the case and that |

|determination of the minor's physical incapacity for trial; or |
|(iii) an interlocutory appeal. Any such delay shall |
|temporarily suspend, for the time of the delay, the period |
|within which the adjudicatory hearing must be held. On the day |
|of expiration of the delay, the said period shall continue at |
|the point at which it was suspended.|||

|time required by paragraph (b)(1)(A) of this Section, the |
|court shall, upon motion by any party, dismiss the petition |
|with prejudice.|||
|||(2) Without affecting the applicability of the tolling and |
|multiple prosecution provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this |

|minor requires authoritative intervention and the minor is in |
|shelter care, the adjudicatory hearing shall be held within 10 |
|judicial days after the date of the order directing shelter |
|care, or the earliest possible date in compliance with the |
|notice provisions of Sections 3-17 and 3-18 as to the |
|custodial parent, guardian or legal custodian, but no later |
|than 30 judicial days from the date of the order of the court |
|directing shelter care.|||

|||(3) Any failure to comply with the time limits of |
|paragraph (b)(2) of this Section shall require the immediate |
|release of the minor from shelter care, and the time limits of |
|paragraph (b)(1) shall apply.|||
|||(4) Nothing in this Section prevents the minor or the |

|as a respondent in the petition, except that summons need not |
|be directed to a minor respondent under 8 years of age for whom |
|the court appoints a guardian ad litem if the guardian ad litem |
|appears on behalf of the minor in any proceeding under this |
|Act. |||
|||(2) The summons must contain a statement that the minor or |
|any of the respondents is entitled to have an attorney present |
|at the hearing on the petition, and that the clerk of the court |
|should be notified promptly if the minor or any other |
|respondent desires to be represented by an attorney but is |

|court, dated on the day it is issued, and shall require each |
|respondent to appear and answer the petition on the date set |
|for the adjudicatory hearing.|||
|||(4) The summons may be served by any county sheriff, |
|coroner or probation officer, even though the officer is the |
|petitioner. The return of the summons with endorsement of |
|service by the officer is sufficient proof thereof.|||
|||(5) Service of a summons and petition shall be made by: (a) |
|leaving a copy thereof with the person summoned at least 3 days |
|before the time stated therein for appearance; (b) leaving a |
|copy at |_|the summoned person's|_|||his||usual place of abode with |
|some person of the family, of the age of 10 years or upwards, |
|and informing that person of the contents thereof, provided |
|the officer or other person making service shall also send a |
|copy of the summons in a sealed envelope with postage fully |
|prepaid, addressed to the person summoned at |_|the person's|_|||his|||
|usual place of abode, at least 3 days before the time stated |
|therein for appearance; or (c) leaving a copy thereof with the |
|guardian or custodian of a minor, at least 3 days before the |
|time stated therein for appearance. If the guardian or |
|custodian is an agency of the State of Illinois, proper |
|service may be made by leaving a copy of the summons and |
|petition with any administrative employee of such agency |
|designated by such agency to accept service of summons and |
|petitions. The certificate of the officer or affidavit of the |

|person that |_|the officer or person|_|||he||has sent the copy pursuant |
|to this Section is sufficient proof of service.|||
|||(6) When a parent or other person, who has signed a written |
|promise to appear and bring the minor to court or who has |
|waived or acknowledged service, fails to appear with the minor |
|on the date set by the court, a bench warrant may be issued for |

|if any person is made a respondent under the designation of |
|"All whom it may Concern", or if service cannot be made because |

|supporting the petition and before proceeding to findings and |
|adjudication, or after hearing the evidence at the |

|of objection made in open court by the minor, |_|the minor's|_|||his|||

|custodian, responsible relative, defense attorney or State's |
|Attorney, objects in open court to any such continuance and |
|insists upon proceeding to findings and adjudication, the |
|court shall so proceed.|||
|||(3) Nothing in this Section limits the power of the court |
|to order a continuance of the hearing for the production of |
|additional evidence or for any other proper reason.|||
|||(4) When a hearing where a minor is alleged to be a minor |
|requiring authoritative intervention is continued pursuant to |
|this Section, the court may permit the minor to remain in |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his||home subject to such conditions concerning |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his||conduct and supervision as the court may require |
|by order.|||

|||(5) If a petition is filed charging a violation of a |
|condition of the continuance under supervision, the court |
|shall conduct a hearing. If the court finds that such |
|condition of supervision has not been fulfilled the court may |
|proceed to findings and adjudication and disposition. The |
|filing of a petition for violation of a condition of the |
|continuance under supervision shall toll the period of |
|continuance under supervision until the final determination of |
|the charge, and the term of the continuance under supervision |
|shall not run until the hearing and disposition of the |
|petition for violation; provided where the petition alleges |
|conduct that does not constitute a criminal offense, the |
|hearing must be held within 15 days of the filing of the |
|petition unless a delay in such hearing has been occasioned by |
|the minor, in which case the delay shall continue the tolling |
|of the period of continuance under supervision for the period |
|of such delay.|||

|continuance under supervision or an order of disposition under |
|this Article III, as a condition of the order, a fee of $25 for |
|each month or partial month of supervision with a probation |
|officer. If the court determines the inability of the minor, |
|or the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the minor to pay |
|the fee, the court may impose a lesser fee. The court may not |
|impose the fee on a minor who is placed in the guardianship or |
|custody of the Department of Children and Family Services |

|under this Act. The fee may be imposed only upon a minor who is |
|actively supervised by the probation and court services |
|department. The fee must be collected by the clerk of the |
|circuit court. The clerk of the circuit court must pay all |
|monies collected from this fee to the county treasurer for |

|||(1) After hearing the evidence the court shall make and |
|note in the minutes of the proceeding a finding of whether or |
|not the person is a minor requiring authoritative |
|intervention. If it finds that the minor is not such a person, |
|the court shall order the petition dismissed and the minor |
|discharged from any restriction previously ordered in such |
|proceeding.|||
|||(2) If the court finds that the person is a minor requiring |
|authoritative intervention, the court shall note in its |
|findings that |_|the minor|_|||he or she||does require authoritative |
|intervention. The court shall then set a time for a |
|dispositional hearing to be conducted under Section 3-23 at |
|which hearing the court shall determine whether it is in the |
|best interests of the minor and the public that |_|the minor|_|||he||be |
|made a ward of the court. To assist the court in making this |

|and other determinations at the dispositional hearing, the |
|court may order that an investigation be conducted and a |
|dispositional report be prepared concerning the minor's |
|physical and mental history and condition, family situation |
|and background, economic status, education, occupation, |
|history of delinquency or criminality, personal habits, and |
|any other information that may be helpful to the court.|||

_|minor|_|||he||is to be made a ward of the court, the court shall |
|determine the proper disposition best serving the interests of |

|these questions, including oral and written reports, may be |
|admitted and may be relied upon to the extent of its probative |
|value, even though not competent for the purposes of the |
|adjudicatory hearing.|||
|||(2) Notice in compliance with Sections 3-17 and 3-18 must |
|be given to all parties-respondent prior to proceeding to a |

|the court shall advise the State's Attorney, the parents, |
|guardian, custodian or responsible relative or their counsel |

|of the factual contents and the conclusions of the reports |
|prepared for the use of the court and considered by it, and |
|afford fair opportunity, if requested, to controvert them. The |
|court may order, however, that the documents containing such |
|reports need not be submitted for inspection, or that sources |
|of confidential information need not be disclosed except to |
|the attorneys for the parties. Factual contents, conclusions, |

|made in respect to wards of the court: A minor found to be |

|requiring authoritative intervention under Section 3-3 may be |
|(a) committed to the Department of Children and Family |
|Services, subject to Section 5 of the Children and Family |

_|minor's|_|||his or her||parents, guardian or legal custodian; (c) |
|placed in accordance with Section 3-28 with or without also |

|be modified or terminated by the court if it deems that the |
|best interests of the minor and the public will be served |
|thereby; (d) ordered partially or completely emancipated in |
|accordance with the provisions of the Emancipation of Minors |
|Act; or (e) subject to having |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||driver's |
|license or driving privilege suspended for such time as |
|determined by the Court but only until |_|the minor|_|||he or she|||
|attains 18 years of age.|||
|||(2) Any order of disposition may provide for protective |
|supervision under Section 3-25 and may include an order of |
|protection under Section 3-26.|||
|||(3) Unless the order of disposition expressly so provides, |
|it does not operate to close proceedings on the pending |
|petition, but is subject to modification until final closing |
|and discharge of the proceedings under Section 3-32.|||
|||(4) In addition to any other order of disposition, the |
|court may order any person found to be a minor requiring |
|authoritative intervention under Section 3-3 to make |
|restitution, in monetary or non-monetary form, under the terms |

|and conditions of Section 5-5-6 of the Unified Code of |
|Corrections, except that the "presentence hearing" referred to |
|therein shall be the dispositional hearing for purposes of |
|this Section. The parent, guardian or legal custodian of the |
|minor may pay some or all of such restitution on the minor's |
|behalf.|||
|||(5) Any order for disposition where the minor is committed |
|or placed in accordance with Section 3-28 shall provide for |
|the parents or guardian of the estate of such minor to pay to |
|the legal custodian or guardian of the person of the minor such |
|sums as are determined by the custodian or guardian of the |
|person of the minor as necessary for the minor's needs. Such |
|payments may not exceed the maximum amounts provided for by |
|Section 9.1 of the Children and Family Services Act.|||
|||(6) Whenever the order of disposition requires the minor |
|to attend school or participate in a program of training, the |

|report to the court if the minor is a chronic or habitual |
|truant under Section 26-2a of the School Code.|||

|the fee, the court may impose a lesser fee. The court may not |

|impose the fee on a minor who is placed in the guardianship or |
|custody of the Department of Children and Family Services |
|under this Act. The fee may be imposed only upon a minor who is |
|actively supervised by the probation and court services |
|department. The fee must be collected by the clerk of the |

|by this Act. The order of protection may set forth reasonable |
|conditions of behavior to be observed for a specified period. |
|Such an order may require a person:|||||

|||||(f) To prohibit and prevent any contact whatsoever |
|with the respondent minor by a specified individual or |
|individuals who are alleged in either a criminal or |
|juvenile proceeding to have caused injury to a respondent |
|minor or a sibling of a respondent minor;|||||
|||||(g) To refrain from acts of commission or omission |
|that tend to make the home not a proper place for the |
|minor.|||
|||(2) The court shall enter an order of protection to |

|prohibit and prevent any contact between a respondent minor or |
|a sibling of a respondent minor and any person named in a |
|petition seeking an order of protection who has been convicted |
|of heinous battery or aggravated battery under subdivision |

|any person as provided by this Section, the court shall direct |
|a copy of such order to the Sheriff of that county. The Sheriff |
|shall furnish a copy of the order of protection to the Illinois |
|State Police within 24 hours of receipt, in the form and manner |
|required by the Department. The Illinois State Police shall |
|maintain a complete record and index of such orders of |
|protection and make this data available to all local law |
|enforcement agencies.|||
|||(4) After notice and opportunity for hearing afforded to a |
|person subject to an order of protection, the order may be |
|modified or extended for a further specified period or both or |
|may be terminated if the court finds that the best interests of |

|the minor and the public will be served thereby.|||
|||(5) An order of protection may be sought at any time during |
|the course of any proceeding conducted pursuant to this Act. |
|Any person against whom an order of protection is sought may |
|retain counsel to represent |_|the person|_|||him||at a hearing, and |
|has rights to be present at the hearing, to be informed prior |
|to the hearing in writing of the contents of the petition |
|seeking a protective order and of the date, place and time of |
|such hearing, and to cross examine witnesses called by the |
|petitioner and to present witnesses and argument in opposition |
|to the relief sought in the petition.|||

|serve any person or persons against whom any order of |
|protection is sought with written notice of the contents of |
|the petition seeking a protective order and of the date, place |
|and time at which the hearing on the petition is to be held. |
|When a protective order is being sought in conjunction with a |
|shelter care hearing, if the court finds that the person |
|against whom the protective order is being sought has been |
|notified of the hearing or that diligent efforts have been |
|made to notify such person, the court may conduct a hearing. If |
|a protective order is sought at any time other than in |
|conjunction with a shelter care hearing, the court may not |
|conduct a hearing on the petition in the absence of the person |
|against whom the order is sought unless the petitioner has |
|notified such person by personal service at least 3 days |

|before the hearing or has sent written notice by first class |
|mail to such person's last known address at least 5 days before |
|the hearing.|||
|||(7) A person against whom an order of protection is being |
|sought who is neither a parent, guardian, legal custodian or |
|responsible relative as described in Section 1-5 is not a |
|party or respondent as defined in that Section and shall not be |
|entitled to the rights provided therein. Such person does not |
|have a right to appointed counsel or to be present at any |
|hearing other than the hearing in which the order of |
|protection is being sought or a hearing directly pertaining to |
|that order. Unless the court orders otherwise, such person |
|does not have a right to inspect the court file.|||
|||(8) All protective orders entered under this Section shall |
|be in writing. Unless the person against whom the order was |
|obtained was present in court when the order was issued, the |
|sheriff, other law enforcement official or special process |
|server shall promptly serve that order upon that person and |
|file proof of such service, in the manner provided for service |
|of process in civil proceedings. The person against whom the |
|protective order was obtained may seek a modification of the |
|order by filing a written motion to modify the order within 7 |
|days after actual receipt by the person of a copy of the order.|||

|by the court concerning such persons and setting forth its |
|terms and requirements. The presentation of the certificate to |

|are unwilling to do so, and that appropriate services aimed at |
|family preservation and family reunification have been |
|unsuccessful in rectifying the conditions which have led to |
|such a finding of unfitness or inability to care for, protect, |
|train or discipline the minor, and that it is in the best |
|interest of the minor to take |_|the minor|_|||him||from the custody of |
_|the minor's|_|||his||parents, guardian or custodian, the court may:|||||

|in placing the child. In addition, whenever alternative plans |
|for placement are available, the court shall ascertain and |

|the views and preferences of the minor.|||

|person of the minor. When a minor is committed to any agency, |
|the court shall appoint the proper officer or representative |
|thereof as legal custodian or guardian of the person of the |
|minor. Legal custodians and guardians of the person of the |
|minor have the respective rights and duties set forth in |

_|custodian or guardian|_|||him||into court and require |_|the legal |_
_|custodian, guardian,|_|||him||or |_|the legal custodian's or |_

|either in writing verified by affidavit or orally under oath |
|in open court, or otherwise as the court directs. Upon the |

|surrender |_|the minor|_|||him or her||for adoption to an agency |
|legally authorized or licensed to place children for adoption.|||
|||(2) If the petition prays and the court finds that it is in |
|the best interests of the minor that a guardian of the person |
|be appointed and authorized to consent to the adoption of the |
|minor, the court with the consent of the parents, if living, or |
|after finding, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that |
|a non-consenting parent is an unfit person as defined in |
|Section 1 of |_|the Adoption Act|_|||"An Act in relation to the |
|adoption of persons, and to repeal an Act therein named", |

|of the person of the minor, in the order appointing |_|the person|_||
|him or her||as such guardian, to appear in court where any |

|pending and to consent to the adoption. Such consent is |
|sufficient to authorize the court in the adoption proceedings |

|to enter a proper order or judgment of adoption without |
|further notice to, or consent by, the parents of the minor. An |
|order so empowering the guardian to consent to adoption |
|terminates parental rights, deprives the parents of the minor |
|of all legal rights as respects the minor and relieves them of |
|all parental responsibility for |_|the minor|_|||him or her||, and |
|frees the minor from all obligations of maintenance and |
|obedience to |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||natural parents.|||
|||If the minor is over 14 years of age, the court may, in its |

|||Sec. 3-33.5. ||Truant minors in need of supervision.|||
|||(a) Definition. A minor who is reported by the office of |
|the regional superintendent of schools as a chronic truant may |
|be subject to a petition for adjudication and adjudged a |
|truant minor in need of supervision, provided that prior to |
|the filing of the petition, the office of the regional |
|superintendent of schools or a community truancy review board |
|certifies that the local school has provided appropriate |
|truancy intervention services to the truant minor and |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his or her||family. For purposes of this Section, |
|"truancy intervention services" means services designed to |
|assist the minor's return to an educational program, and |
|includes but is not limited to: assessments, counseling, |
|mental health services, shelter, optional and alternative |
|education programs, tutoring, and educational advocacy. If, |
|after review by the regional office of education or community |
|truancy review board, it is determined the local school did |
|not provide the appropriate interventions, then the minor |
|shall be referred to a comprehensive community based youth |
|service agency for truancy intervention services. If the |
|comprehensive community based youth service agency is |

|incapable to provide intervention services, then this |
|requirement for services is not applicable. The comprehensive |
|community based youth service agency shall submit reports to |
|the office of the regional superintendent of schools or |
|truancy review board within 20, 40, and 80 school days of the |
|initial referral or at any other time requested by the office |
|of the regional superintendent of schools or truancy review |
|board, which reports each shall certify the date of the |
|minor's referral and the extent of the minor's progress and |
|participation in truancy intervention services provided by the |
|comprehensive community based youth service agency. In |
|addition, if, after referral by the office of the regional |
|superintendent of schools or community truancy review board, |
|the minor declines or refuses to fully participate in truancy |
|intervention services provided by the comprehensive community |
|based youth service agency, then the agency shall immediately |
|certify such facts to the office of the regional |
|superintendent of schools or community truancy review board.|
|||(a-1) There is a rebuttable presumption that a chronic |
|truant is a truant minor in need of supervision.|
|||(a-2) There is a rebuttable presumption that school |
|records of a minor's attendance at school are authentic.|
|||(a-3) For purposes of this Section, "chronic truant" has |
|the meaning ascribed to it in Section 26-2a of the School Code.|
|||(a-4) For purposes of this Section, a "community truancy |
|review board" is a local community based board comprised of |

|but not limited to: representatives from local comprehensive |
|community based youth service agencies, representatives from |
|court service agencies, representatives from local schools, |
|representatives from health service agencies, and |
|representatives from local professional and community |
|organizations as deemed appropriate by the office of the |
|regional superintendent of schools. The regional |
|superintendent of schools must approve the establishment and |
|organization of a community truancy review board, and the |
|regional superintendent of schools or |_|the regional |_
_|superintendent's|_|||his or her||designee shall chair the board.|
|||(a-5) Nothing in this Section shall be construed to create |
|a private cause of action or right of recovery against a |
|regional office of education, its superintendent, or its staff |
|with respect to truancy intervention services where the |
|determination to provide the services is made in good faith.|
|||(b) Kinds of dispositional orders. A minor found to be a |
|truant minor in need of supervision may be:|
|||||(1) committed to the appropriate regional |
|superintendent of schools for a student assistance team |
|staffing, a service plan, or referral to a comprehensive |
|community based youth service agency;|
|||||(2) required to comply with a service plan as |
|specifically provided by the appropriate regional |
|superintendent of schools;|
|||||(3) ordered to obtain counseling or other supportive |

|services;|
|||||(4) (blank);|
|||||(5) required to perform some reasonable public service |
|work such as, but not limited to, the picking up of litter |
|in public parks or along public highways or the |
|maintenance of public facilities; or|
|||||(6) (blank).|
|||A dispositional order may include public service only if |
|the court has made an express written finding that a truancy |
|prevention program has been offered by the school, regional |
|superintendent of schools, or a comprehensive community based |
|youth service agency to the truant minor in need of |
|supervision.|

|Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).|||
|||(6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a |

|within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon |
|request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the |
|clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later |
|than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons |
|directed to the parent, guardian or custodian to appear. At |
|the same time the probation department shall prepare a report |

|on the minor. If a parent, guardian or custodian does not |
|appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order |
|prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place |
|designated by the Department of Children and Family Services |
|or a licensed child welfare agency.|||
|||(8) Any interested party, including the State, the |
|temporary custodian, an agency providing services to the minor |
|or family under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the |
|Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or |
|any of their representatives, may file a motion to modify or |
|vacate a temporary custody order on any of the following |
|grounds:|||
|||||(a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent |
|necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or|||
|||||(b) There is a material change in the circumstances of |
|the natural family from which the minor was removed; or|||
|||||(c) A person, including a parent, relative or legal |
|guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the |
|minor; or|||
|||||(d) Services provided by the Department of Children |
|and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other |
|service provider have been successful in eliminating the |
|need for temporary custody.|||
|||The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than |
|14 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court |
|modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not |

|vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that |
|appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of |
|the minor and |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||family.|||

|||The 120 day period in which an adjudicatory hearing shall |

|be directed to a minor respondent under 8 years of age for whom |
|the court appoints a guardian ad litem if the guardian ad litem |
|appears on behalf of the minor in any proceeding under this |
|Act.|||
|||(2) The summons must contain a statement that the minor or |
|any of the respondents is entitled to have an attorney present |
|at the hearing on the petition, and that the clerk of the court |
|should be notified promptly if the minor or any other |
|respondent desires to be represented by an attorney but is |
|financially unable to employ counsel.|||
|||(3) The summons shall be issued under the seal of the |
|court, attested to and signed with the name of the clerk of the |
|court, dated on the day it is issued, and shall require each |
|respondent to appear and answer the petition on the date set |
|for the adjudicatory hearing.|||
|||(4) The summons may be served by any county sheriff, |
|coroner or probation officer, even though the officer is the |
|petitioner. The return of the summons with endorsement of |
|service by the officer is sufficient proof thereof.|||
|||(5) Service of a summons and petition shall be made by: (a) |
|leaving a copy thereof with the person summoned at least 3 days |
|before the time stated therein for appearance; (b) leaving a |
|copy at |_|the summoned person's|_|||his||usual place of abode with |
|some person of the family, of the age of 10 years or upwards, |
|and informing that person of the contents thereof, provided |
|that the officer or other person making service shall also |

|send a copy of the summons in a sealed envelope with postage |
|fully prepaid, addressed to the person summoned at |_|the |_
_|person's|_|||his||usual place of abode, at least 3 days before the |
|time stated therein for appearance; or (c) leaving a copy |
|thereof with the guardian or custodian of a minor, at least 3 |
|days before the time stated therein for appearance. If the |
|guardian or custodian is an agency of the State of Illinois, |
|proper service may be made by leaving a copy of the summons and |
|petition with any administrative employee of such agency |
|designated by such agency to accept service of summons and |
|petitions. The certificate of the officer or affidavit of the |
|person that |_|the officer or person|_|||he||has sent the copy pursuant |
|to this Section is sufficient proof of service.|||
|||(6) When a parent or other person, who has signed a written |
|promise to appear and bring the minor to court or who has |
|waived or acknowledged service, fails to appear with the minor |
|on the date set by the court, a bench warrant may be issued for |
|the parent or other person, the minor, or both.|||
|||(7) The appearance of the minor's legal guardian or |
|custodian, or a person named as a respondent in a petition, in |

|may be made by certified mail. In such case the clerk shall |
|mail the summons and a copy of the petition to that respondent |
|by certified mail marked for delivery to addressee only. The |
|court shall not proceed with the adjudicatory hearing until 5 |
|days after such mailing. The regular return receipt for |
|certified mail is sufficient proof of service.|||
|||(2) If service upon individuals as provided in Section |
|4-14 is not made on any respondents within a reasonable time or |
|if any person is made a respondent under the designation of |
|"All whom it may Concern", or if service cannot be made because |
|the whereabouts of a respondent are unknown, service may be |
|made by publication. The clerk of the court as soon as possible |
|shall cause publication to be made once in a newspaper of |
|general circulation in the county where the action is pending. |
|Notice by publication is not required in any case when the |

|served with summons personally or by certified mail, but the |

|who cannot be served with process other than by publication |
|unless notice by publication is given or unless that person |

|adjudication, or after hearing the evidence at the |

|Attorney, objects in open court to any such continuance and |
|insists upon proceeding to findings and adjudication, the |
|court shall so proceed.|||
|||(3) Nothing in this Section limits the power of the court |
|to order a continuance of the hearing for the production of |
|additional evidence or for any other proper reason.|||
|||(4) When a hearing is continued pursuant to this Section, |
|the court may permit the minor to remain in |_|the minor's|_|||his|||
|home subject to such conditions concerning |_|the minor's|_|||his|||
|conduct and supervision as the court may require by order.|||

|condition of supervision has not been fulfilled the court may |
|proceed to findings and adjudication and disposition. The |
|filing of a petition for violation of a condition of the |

|shall not run until the hearing and disposition of the |

|conduct that does not constitute a criminal offense, the |

|the fee, the court may impose a lesser fee. The court may not |
|impose the fee on a minor who is placed in the guardianship or |

|||Sec. 4-21. ||Kinds of dispositional orders. |||
|||(1) A minor found to be addicted under Section 4-3 may be |
|(a) committed to the Department of Children and Family |
|Services, subject to Section 5 of the Children and Family |
|Services Act; (b) placed under supervision and released to |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his or her||parents, guardian or legal custodian; (c) |
|placed in accordance with Section 4-25 with or without also |
|being placed under supervision. Conditions of supervision may |
|be modified or terminated by the court if it deems that the |
|best interests of the minor and the public will be served |
|thereby; (d) required to attend an approved alcohol or drug |
|abuse treatment or counseling program on an inpatient or |
|outpatient basis instead of or in addition to the disposition |
|otherwise provided for in this paragraph; (e) ordered |
|partially or completely emancipated in accordance with the |

|to having |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||driver's license or driving |
|privilege suspended for such time as determined by the Court |

|but only until |_|the minor|_|||he or she||attains 18 years of age. No |
|disposition under this subsection shall provide for the |
|minor's placement in a secure facility.|||
|||(2) Any order of disposition may provide for protective |
|supervision under Section 4-22 and may include an order of |
|protection under Section 4-23.|||
|||(3) Unless the order of disposition expressly so provides, |
|it does not operate to close proceedings on the pending |
|petition, but is subject to modification until final closing |
|and discharge of the proceedings under Section 4-29.|||
|||(4) In addition to any other order of disposition, the |
|court may order any minor found to be addicted under this |
|Article as neglected with respect to |_|the minor's|_|||his or her own|||
|injurious behavior, to make restitution, in monetary or |
|non-monetary form, under the terms and conditions of Section |
|5-5-6 of the Unified Code of Corrections, except that the |
|"presentence hearing" referred to therein shall be the |
|dispositional hearing for purposes of this Section. The |
|parent, guardian or legal custodian of the minor may pay some |
|or all of such restitution on the minor's behalf.|||
|||(5) Any order for disposition where the minor is placed in |
|accordance with Section 4-25 shall provide for the parents or |
|guardian of the estate of such minor to pay to the legal |
|custodian or guardian of the person of the minor such sums as |
|are determined by the custodian or guardian of the person of |
|the minor as necessary for the minor's needs. Such payments |

|may not exceed the maximum amounts provided for by Section 9.1 |

|||(6) Whenever the order of disposition requires the minor |
|to attend school or participate in a program of training, the |
|truant officer or designated school official shall regularly |
|report to the court if the minor is a chronic or habitual |
|truant under Section 26-2a of the School Code.|||
|||(7) The court must impose upon a minor under an order of |
|continuance under supervision or an order of disposition under |
|this Article IV, as a condition of the order, a fee of $25 for |
|each month or partial month of supervision with a probation |
|officer. If the court determines the inability of the minor, |
|or the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the minor to pay |
|the fee, the court may impose a lesser fee. The court may not |
|impose the fee on a minor who is placed in the guardianship or |
|custody of the Department of Children and Family Services |
|under this Act. The fee may be imposed only upon a minor who is |
|actively supervised by the probation and court services |
|department. The fee must be collected by the clerk of the |
|circuit court. The clerk of the circuit court must pay all |
|monies collected from this fee to the county treasurer for |
|deposit into the probation and court services fund under |
|Section 15.1 of the Probation and Probation Officers Act.|||

|||(1) The court may make an order of protection in |
|assistance of or as a condition of any other order authorized |
|by this Act. The order of protection may set forth reasonable |
|conditions of behavior to be observed for a specified period. |
|Such an order may require a person:|||||

|||||(b) To permit a parent to visit the minor at stated |
|periods;|||||
|||||(c) To abstain from offensive conduct against the |

|agency or association to which the minor is referred by |
|the court;|||||
|||||(f) To prohibit and prevent any contact whatsoever |
|with the respondent minor by a specified individual or |
|individuals who are alleged in either a criminal or |
|juvenile proceeding to have caused injury to a respondent |
|minor or a sibling of a respondent minor;|||||
|||||(g) To refrain from acts of commission or omission |
|that tend to make the home not a proper place for the |
|minor.|||
|||(2) The court shall enter an order of protection to |
|prohibit and prevent any contact between a respondent minor or |
|a sibling of a respondent minor and any person named in a |
|petition seeking an order of protection who has been convicted |
|of heinous battery or aggravated battery under subdivision |

|described in the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of |
|2012, or has been convicted of an offense that resulted in the |
|death of a child, or has violated a previous order of |

|protection under this Section.|||
|||(3) When the court issues an order of protection against |
|any person as provided by this Section, the court shall direct |
|a copy of such order to the Sheriff of that county. The Sheriff |
|shall furnish a copy of the order of protection to the Illinois |
|State Police within 24 hours of receipt, in the form and manner |
|required by the Department. The Illinois State Police shall |
|maintain a complete record and index of such orders of |
|protection and make this data available to all local law |
|enforcement agencies.|||
|||(4) After notice and opportunity for hearing afforded to a |
|person subject to an order of protection, the order may be |
|modified or extended for a further specified period or both or |
|may be terminated if the court finds that the best interests of |
|the minor and the public will be served thereby.|||
|||(5) An order of protection may be sought at any time during |
|the course of any proceeding conducted pursuant to this Act. |
|Any person against whom an order of protection is sought may |
|retain counsel to represent |_|the person|_|||him||at a hearing, and |
|has rights to be present at the hearing, to be informed prior |
|to the hearing in writing of the contents of the petition |
|seeking a protective order and of the date, place and time of |
|such hearing, and to cross examine witnesses called by the |
|petitioner and to present witnesses and argument in opposition |
|to the relief sought in the petition.|||
|||(6) Diligent efforts shall be made by the petitioner to |

|serve any person or persons against whom any order of |
|protection is sought with written notice of the contents of |
|the petition seeking a protective order and of the date, place |
|and time at which the hearing on the petition is to be held. |
|When a protective order is being sought in conjunction with a |
|shelter care hearing, if the court finds that the person |
|against whom the protective order is being sought has been |
|notified of the hearing or that diligent efforts have been |
|made to notify such person, the court may conduct a hearing. If |
|a protective order is sought at any time other than in |
|conjunction with a shelter care hearing, the court may not |
|conduct a hearing on the petition in the absence of the person |
|against whom the order is sought unless the petitioner has |
|notified such person by personal service at least 3 days |
|before the hearing or has sent written notice by first class |
|mail to such person's last known address at least 5 days before |
|the hearing.|||
|||(7) A person against whom an order of protection is being |
|sought who is neither a parent, guardian, legal custodian or |
|responsible relative as described in Section 1-5 is not a |
|party or respondent as defined in that Section and shall not be |
|entitled to the rights provided therein. Such person does not |
|have a right to appointed counsel or to be present at any |
|hearing other than the hearing in which the order of |
|protection is being sought or a hearing directly pertaining to |
|that order. Unless the court orders otherwise, such person |

|does not have a right to inspect the court file.|||
|||(8) All protective orders entered under this Section shall |
|be in writing. Unless the person against whom the order was |
|obtained was present in court when the order was issued, the |
|sheriff, other law enforcement official or special process |
|server shall promptly serve that order upon that person and |
|file proof of such service, in the manner provided for service |
|of process in civil proceedings. The person against whom the |
|protective order was obtained may seek a modification of the |
|order by filing a written motion to modify the order within 7 |
|days after actual receipt by the person of a copy of the order.|||

|by the court concerning such persons and setting forth its |

|terms and requirements. The presentation of the certificate to |

|||Sec. 4-25. ||Placement; legal custody or guardianship. |||
|||(1) If the court finds that the parents, guardian or legal |
|custodian of a minor adjudged a ward of the court are unfit or |
|are unable, for some reason other than financial circumstances |
|alone, to care for, protect, train or discipline the minor or |
|are unwilling to do so, and that appropriate services aimed at |
|family preservation and family reunification have been |
|unsuccessful in rectifying the conditions which have led to a |
|finding of unfitness or inability to care for, protect, train |
|or discipline the minor, and that it is in the best interest of |
|the minor to take |_|the minor|_|||him||from the custody of |_|the
minor's|_||
|his||parents, guardian or custodian, the court may:|||||
|||||(a) place |_|the minor|_|||him||in the custody of a suitable |
|relative or other person;|||||
|||||(b) place |_|the minor|_|||him||under the guardianship of a |
|probation officer;|||||

|||||(c) commit |_|the minor|_|||him||to an agency for care or |
|placement, except an institution under the authority of |
|the Department of Corrections or of the Department of |
|Children and Family Services;|||||
|||||(d) commit |_|the minor|_|||him||to some licensed training |
|school or industrial school; or|||||
|||||(e) commit |_|the minor|_|||him||to any appropriate |
|institution having among its purposes the care of |
|delinquent children, including a child protective facility |
|maintained by a Child Protection District serving the |
|county from which commitment is made, but not including |
|any institution under the authority of the Department of |
|Corrections or of the Department of Children and Family |
|Services.|||
|||(2) When making such placement, the court, wherever |
|possible, shall select a person holding the same religious |
|belief as that of the minor or a private agency controlled by |
|persons of like religious faith of the minor and shall require |
|the Department of Children and Family Services to otherwise |
|comply with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act |
|in placing the child. In addition, whenever alternative plans |
|for placement are available, the court shall ascertain and |
|consider, to the extent appropriate in the particular case, |
|the views and preferences of the minor.|||
|||(3) When a minor is placed with a suitable relative or |
|other person, the court shall appoint |_|the suitable relative or |_

_|other person|_|||him||the legal custodian or guardian of the person |
|of the minor. When a minor is committed to any agency, the |
|court shall appoint the proper officer or representative |
|thereof as legal custodian or guardian of the person of the |
|minor. Legal custodians and guardians of the person of the |
|minor have the respective rights and duties set forth in |
|subsection (9) of Section 1-3 except as otherwise provided by |
|order of the court; but no guardian of the person may consent |
|to adoption of the minor unless that authority is conferred |
|upon |_|the guardian|_|||him||in accordance with Section 4-27. An |
|agency whose representative is appointed guardian of the |
|person or legal custodian of the minor may place |_|the minor|_|||him|||
|in any child care facility, but such facility must be licensed |
|under the Child Care Act of 1969 or have been approved by the |
|Department of Children and Family Services as meeting the |
|standards established for such licensing. After June 30, 1981, |
|no agency may place a minor, if the minor is under age 13, in a |
|child care facility unless such placement is in compliance |
|with the rules and regulations for placement under Section |
|4-25 of this Act promulgated by the Department of Children and |
|Family Services under Section 5 of the Children and Family |
|Services Act. Like authority and restrictions shall be |
|conferred by the court upon any probation officer who has been |
|appointed guardian of the person of a minor.|||
|||(4) No placement by any probation officer or agency whose |
|representative is appointed guardian of the person or legal |

|custodian of a minor may be made in any out of State child care |
|facility unless it complies with the Interstate Compact on the |
|Placement of Children.|||
|||(5) The clerk of the court shall issue to the legal |
|custodian or guardian of the person a certified copy of the |
|order of the court, as proof of |_|the legal custodian's or |_
_|guardian's|_|||his||authority. No other process is necessary as |
|authority for the keeping of the minor.|||

|continues until the court otherwise directs, but not after the |
|minor reaches the age of 19 years except as set forth in |
|Section 4-29.|||

|||(705 ILCS 405/4-26)||||(from Ch. 37, par. 804-26)|||||||
|||Sec. 4-26. ||Court Review. ||(1) The court may require any |
|legal custodian or guardian of the person appointed under this |
|Act to report periodically to the court or may cite |_|the legal |_
_|custodian or guardian|_|||him||into court and require |_|the legal |_
_|custodian or guardian|_|||him||or |_|the legal custodian's or |_
_|guardian's|_|||his||agency, to make a full and accurate report of |
_|the|_|||his or its||doings |_|of the legal custodian, guardian, or |_
_|agency on|_|||in||behalf of the minor. The custodian or guardian, |
|within 10 days after such citation, shall make the report, |
|either in writing verified by affidavit or orally under oath |
|in open court, or otherwise as the court directs. Upon the |

|hearing of the report the court may remove the custodian or |
|guardian and appoint another in |_|the legal custodian's or |_
_|guardian's|_|||his||stead or restore the minor to the custody of |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his||parents or former guardian or custodian.|||
|||(2) A guardian or custodian appointed by the court |
|pursuant to this Act shall file updated case plans with the |
|court every 6 months. Every agency which has guardianship of a |
|child shall file a supplemental petition for court review, or |
|review by an administrative body appointed or approved by the |
|court and further order within 18 months of dispositional |
|order and each 18 months thereafter. Such petition shall state |
|facts relative to the child's present condition of physical, |
|mental and emotional health as well as facts relative to |_|the |_
_|child's|_|||his||present custodial or foster care. The petition |
|shall be set for hearing and the clerk shall mail 10 days |
|notice of the hearing by certified mail, return receipt |
|requested, to the person or agency having the physical custody |
|of the child, the minor and other interested parties unless a |
|written waiver of notice is filed with the petition.|||
|||Rights of wards of the court under this Act are |
|enforceable against any public agency by complaints for relief |
|by mandamus filed in any proceedings brought under this Act.|||
|||(3) The minor or any person interested in the minor may |
|apply to the court for a change in custody of the minor and the |
|appointment of a new custodian or guardian of the person or for |
|the restoration of the minor to the custody of |_|the minor's|_|||his|||

|parents or former guardian or custodian. In the event that the |
|minor has attained 18 years of age and the guardian or |
|custodian petitions the court for an order terminating |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his||guardianship or custody, guardianship or custody |
|shall terminate automatically 30 days after the receipt of the |
|petition unless the court orders otherwise. No legal custodian |
|or guardian of the person may be removed without |_|the legal |_
_|custodian's or guardian's|_|||his||consent until given notice and |
|an opportunity to be heard by the court.|||

|adoption of persons, and to repeal an Act therein named", |

|required by such Act, surrender |_|the minor|_|||him or her||for |
|adoption to an agency legally authorized or licensed to place |
|children for adoption.|||
|||(2) If the petition prays and the court finds that it is in |
|the best interests of the minor that a guardian of the person |
|be appointed and authorized to consent to the adoption of the |
|minor, the court with the consent of the parents, if living, or |

|after finding, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that |
|a non-consenting parent is an unfit person as defined in |
|Section 1 of |_|the Adoption Act|_|||"An Act in relation to the |
|adoption of persons, and to repeal an Act therein named", |
|approved July 17, 1959, as amended||, may empower the guardian |
|of the person of the minor, in the order appointing |_|the person|_||
|him or her||as such guardian, to appear in court where any |
|proceedings for the adoption of the minor may at any time be |
|pending and to consent to the adoption. Such consent is |
|sufficient to authorize the court in the adoption proceedings |
|to enter a proper order or judgment of adoption without |
|further notice to, or consent by, the parents of the minor. An |
|order so empowering the guardian to consent to adoption |
|terminates parental rights, deprives the parents of the minor |
|of all legal rights as respects the minor and relieves them of |
|all parental responsibility for |_|the minor|_|||him or her||, and |
|frees the minor from all obligations of maintenance and |
|obedience to |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||natural parents.|||
|||If the minor is over 14 years of age, the court may, in its |
|discretion, consider the wishes of the minor in determining |
|whether the best interests of the minor would be promoted by |
|the finding of the unfitness of a non-consenting parent.|||
|||(3) Parental consent to the order authorizing the guardian |
|of the person to consent to adoption of the Minor shall be |
|given in open court whenever possible and otherwise must be in |

|Act in relation to the adoption of persons, and to repeal an |

|||(1) It is the intent of the General Assembly to promote a |
|juvenile justice system capable of dealing with the problem of |
|juvenile delinquency, a system that will protect the |
|community, impose accountability for violations of law and |
|equip juvenile offenders with competencies to live responsibly |
|and productively. To effectuate this intent, the General |
|Assembly declares the following to be important purposes of |
|this Article:|||||
|||||(a) To protect citizens from juvenile crime.|||||
|||||(b) To hold each juvenile offender directly |

|accountable for |_|the juvenile's|_|||his or her||acts.|||||
|||||(c) To provide an individualized assessment of each |
|alleged and adjudicated delinquent juvenile, in order to |
|rehabilitate and to prevent further delinquent behavior |
|through the development of competency in the juvenile |
|offender. As used in this Section, "competency" means the |
|development of educational, vocational, social, emotional |
|and basic life skills which enable a minor to mature into a |
|productive member of society.|||||
|||||(d) To provide due process, as required by the |
|Constitutions of the United States and the State of |
|Illinois, through which each juvenile offender and all |
|other interested parties are assured fair hearings at |
|which legal rights are recognized and enforced.|||
|||(2) To accomplish these goals, juvenile justice policies |
|developed pursuant to this Article shall be designed to:|||||
|||||(a) Promote the development and implementation of |
|community-based programs designed to prevent unlawful and |
|delinquent behavior and to effectively minimize the depth |
|and duration of the minor's involvement in the juvenile |
|justice system;|||||
|||||(b) Provide secure confinement for minors who present |
|a danger to the community and make those minors understand |
|that sanctions for serious crimes, particularly violent |
|felonies, should be commensurate with the seriousness of |
|the offense and merit strong punishment;|||||

|||||(c) Protect the community from crimes committed by |
|minors;|||||
|||||(d) Provide programs and services that are |
|community-based and that are in close proximity to the |
|minor's home;|||||
|||||(e) Allow minors to reside within their homes whenever |
|possible and appropriate and provide support necessary to |
|make this possible;|||||
|||||(f) Base probation treatment planning upon individual |
|case management plans;|||||
|||||(g) Include the minor's family in the case management |
|plan;|||||
|||||(h) Provide supervision and service coordination where |
|appropriate; implement and monitor the case management |
|plan in order to discourage recidivism;|||||
|||||(i) Provide post-release services to minors who are |
|returned to their families and communities after |
|detention;|||||
|||||(j) Hold minors accountable for their unlawful |
|behavior and not allow minors to think that their |
|delinquent acts have no consequence for themselves and |
|others.|||
|||(3) In all procedures under this Article, minors shall |
|have all the procedural rights of adults in criminal |
|proceedings, unless specifically precluded by laws that |
|enhance the protection of such minors. Minors shall not have |

|the right to a jury trial unless specifically provided by this |

|||Sec. 5-310. ||Community mediation program. |||
|||(1) Program purpose. The purpose of community mediation is |
|to provide a system by which minors who commit delinquent acts |

|may be dealt with in a speedy and informal manner at the |
|community or neighborhood level. The goal is to make the |
|juvenile understand the seriousness of |_|the juvenile's|_|||his or |
|her||actions and the effect that a crime has on the minor, |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his or her||family, |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||victim
and |
_|the minor's|_|||his or her||community. In addition, this system |
|offers a method to reduce the ever-increasing instances of |
|delinquent acts while permitting the judicial system to deal |
|effectively with cases that are more serious in nature.|||
|||(2) Community mediation panels. The State's Attorney, or |
|an entity designated by the State's Attorney, may establish |
|community mediation programs designed to provide citizen |
|participation in addressing juvenile delinquency. The State's |
|Attorney, or |_|the State's Attorney's|_|||his or her||designee, shall |
|maintain a list of qualified persons who have agreed to serve |
|as community mediators. To the maximum extent possible, panel |
|membership shall reflect the social-economic, racial and |
|ethnic make-up of the community in which the panel sits. The |
|panel shall consist of members with a diverse background in |
|employment, education and life experience.|||
|||(3) Community mediation cases.|||||
|||||(a) Community mediation programs shall provide one or |
|more community mediation panels to informally hear cases |
|that are referred by a police officer as a station |
|adjustment, or a probation officer as a probation |
|adjustment, or referred by the State's Attorney as a |

|diversion from prosecution.|||||
|||||(b) Minors who are offered the opportunity to |
|participate in the program must admit responsibility for |
|the offense to be eligible for the program.|||
|||(4) Disposition of cases. Subsequent to any hearing held, |
|the community mediation panel may:|||||
|||||(a) Refer the minor for placement in a community-based |
|nonresidential program.|||||
|||||(b) Refer the minor or the minor's family to community |
|counseling.|||||
|||||(c) Require the minor to perform up to 100 hours of |
|community service.|||||
|||||(d) Require the minor to make restitution in money or |
|in kind in a case involving property damage; however, the |
|amount of restitution shall not exceed the amount of |
|actual damage to property.|||||
|||||(e) Require the minor and |_|the minor's|_|||his or her|||
|parent, guardian, or legal custodian to undergo an |
|approved screening for substance abuse or use, or both. If |
|the screening indicates a need, a drug and alcohol |
|assessment of the minor and |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||parent, |
|guardian, or legal custodian shall be conducted by an |
|entity licensed by the Department of Human Services, as a |
|successor to the Department of Alcoholism and Substance |
|Abuse. The minor and |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||parent, |
|guardian, or legal custodian shall adhere to and complete |

|all recommendations to obtain drug and alcohol treatment |
|and counseling resulting from the assessment.|||||
|||||(f) Require the minor to attend school.|||||
|||||(g) Require the minor to attend tutorial sessions.|||||
|||||(h) Impose any other restrictions or sanctions that |
|are designed to encourage responsible and acceptable |
|behavior and are agreed upon by the participants of the |
|community mediation proceedings.|||
|||(5) The agreement shall run no more than 6 months. All |
|community mediation panel members and observers are required |
|to sign the following oath of confidentiality prior to |
|commencing community mediation proceedings:|||||
|||||||"I solemnly swear or affirm that I will not |
|divulge, either by words or signs, any information |
|about the case which comes to my knowledge in the |
|course of a community mediation presentation and that |
|I will keep secret all proceedings which may be held in |
|my presence.|||||
|||||||Further, I understand that if I break |
|confidentiality by telling anyone else the names of |
|community mediation participants, except for |
|information pertaining to the community mediation |
|panelists themselves, or any other specific details of |
|the case which may identify that juvenile, I will no |
|longer be able to serve as a community mediation panel |
|member or observer."|||

|||||(b) take into custody a minor who has been adjudged a |
|ward of the court and has escaped from any commitment |

|persons or allegations that those persons are delinquent |
|minors.|||
|||(a-5) An oral, written, or sign language statement of a |
|minor, who at the time of the commission of the offense was |

|under 18 years of age, is presumed to be inadmissible when the |
|statement is obtained from the minor while the minor is |
|subject to custodial interrogation by a law enforcement |
|officer, State's Attorney, juvenile officer, or other public |
|official or employee prior to the officer, State's Attorney, |
|public official, or employee:|
|||||(1) continuously reads to the minor, in its entirety |
|and without stopping for purposes of a response from the |
|minor or verifying comprehension, the following statement: |
|"You have the right to remain silent. That means you do not |
|have to say anything. Anything you do say can be used |
|against you in court. You have the right to get help from a |
|lawyer. If you cannot pay for a lawyer, the court will get |
|you one for free. You can ask for a lawyer at any time. You |
|have the right to stop this interview at any time."; and|
|||||(2) after reading the statement required by paragraph |
|(1) of this subsection (a-5), the public official or |

|wait for the minor's response to each question:|
|||||||(A) "Do you want to have a lawyer?"|
|||||||(B) "Do you want to talk to me?"|
|||(b) An oral, written, or sign language statement of a |

|committed by an adult would be a misdemeanor offense under |
|Article 11 of the Criminal Code of 2012 or any felony offense |
|unless:|||||
|||||(1) an electronic recording is made of the custodial |
|interrogation; and|||||

|under the age of 18 years, the minor makes a statement that |
|creates a reasonable suspicion to believe the minor has |
|committed an act that if committed by an adult would be an |
|offense other than an offense required to be recorded under |
|subsection (b), the interrogators may, without the minor's |
|consent, continue to record the interrogation as it relates to |
|the other offense notwithstanding any provision of law to the |
|contrary. Any oral, written, or sign language statement of a |

|for any offense relating to the statement is final and all |
|direct and habeas corpus appeals are exhausted, or the |

|||(d) If the court finds, by a preponderance of the |
|evidence, that the minor was subjected to a custodial |
|interrogation in violation of this Section, then any |
|statements made by the minor during or following that |
|non-recorded custodial interrogation, even if otherwise in |
|compliance with this Section, are presumed to be inadmissible |
|in any criminal proceeding or juvenile court proceeding |
|against the minor except for the purposes of impeachment. |||

|a statement made by the minor in open court in any criminal |
|proceeding or juvenile court proceeding, before a grand jury, |

|of the accused as a witness, (iv) of a spontaneous statement |

|be confidential and exempt from public inspection and copying, |

_|minor's|_|||his or her||violation of item (4) of subsection (a) of |

|of 2012 while on school grounds, that finding shall create a |
|presumption that immediate and urgent necessity exists under |

|presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has been raised, |
|the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate and urgent |

|necessity shall be on any party that is opposing detention for |
|the minor. Should the court order detention pursuant to this |
|Section, the minor shall be detained, pending the results of a |

|review the determination regarding the existence of urgent and |
|immediate necessity. The court shall consider the |
|psychological evaluation in conjunction with the other factors |
|identified in subdivision (2) of Section 5-501 of this Act in |
|order to make a de novo determination regarding whether it is a |
|matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the protection of |
|the minor or of the person or property of another that the |
|minor be detained or placed in a shelter care facility. In |
|addition to the pre-trial conditions found in Section 5-505 of |

|from entering the school and school owned or leased property, |
|including any conveyance owned, leased, or contracted by the |

|school to transport students to or from school or a |
|school-related activity. The order shall remain in effect |
|until such time as the court determines that the student no |

|shelter care hearing to determine whether |_|the minor|_|||he or she|||
|shall be further held in custody. If a minor alleged to be a |

|the 40 hour period will not commence until the court rules that |
|the minor is subject to this Act and not subject to prosecution |
|under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012. |
|Any other delay attributable to a minor alleged to be a |

|hearing on the detention or shelter care hearing calendar. |

|Immediately upon the filing of a petition in the case of a |

|immediately if the court is in session and the State is ready |
|to proceed, otherwise at the earliest feasible time. In no |

|of the agency, appoint the appropriate agency executive |

|youth in care of the Department of Children and Family |
|Services, a hearing shall be held every 14 days to determine |
|whether there is an urgent and immediate necessity to detain |
|the minor for the protection of the person or property of |
|another. If urgent and immediate necessity is not found on the |
|basis of the protection of the person or property of another, |
|the minor shall be released to the custody of the Department of |
|Children and Family Services. If the court prescribes |
|detention based on the minor being likely to flee the |
|jurisdiction, and the minor is a youth in care of the |

|Department of Children and Family Services, a hearing shall be |
|held every 7 days for status on the location of shelter care |
|placement by the Department of Children and Family Services. |
|Detention shall not be used as a shelter care placement for |
|minors in the custody or guardianship of the Department of |

|||Sec. 5-525. ||Service. |||
|||(1) Service by summons.|||||
|||||(a) Upon the commencement of a delinquency |
|prosecution, the clerk of the court shall issue a summons |
|with a copy of the petition attached. The summons shall be |
|directed to the minor's parent, guardian or legal |
|custodian and to each person named as a respondent in the |
|petition, except that summons need not be directed (i) to |
|a minor respondent under 8 years of age for whom the court |
|appoints a guardian ad litem if the guardian ad litem |
|appears on behalf of the minor in any proceeding under |
|this Act, or (ii) to a parent who does not reside with the |
|minor, does not make regular child support payments to the |
|minor, to the minor's other parent, or to the minor's |
|legal guardian or custodian pursuant to a support order, |
|and has not communicated with the minor on a regular |
|basis. |||||
|||||(b) The summons must contain a statement that the |
|minor is entitled to have an attorney present at the |
|hearing on the petition, and that the clerk of the court |
|should be notified promptly if the minor desires to be |
|represented by an attorney but is financially unable to |
|employ counsel.|||||
|||||(c) The summons shall be issued under the seal of the |
|court, attested in and signed with the name of the clerk of |

|the court, dated on the day it is issued, and shall require |
|each respondent to appear and answer the petition on the |
|date set for the adjudicatory hearing.|||||
|||||(d) The summons may be served by any law enforcement |
|officer, coroner or probation officer, even though the |
|officer is the petitioner. The return of the summons with |
|endorsement of service by the officer is sufficient proof |
|of service.|||||
|||||(e) Service of a summons and petition shall be made |
|by: (i) leaving a copy of the summons and petition with the |
|person summoned at least 3 days before the time stated in |
|the summons for appearance; (ii) leaving a copy at |_|the |_
_|summoned person's|_|||his or her||usual place of abode with |
|some person of the family, of the age of 10 years or |
|upwards, and informing that person of the contents of the |
|summons and petition, provided, the officer or other |
|person making service shall also send a copy of the |
|summons in a sealed envelope with postage fully prepaid, |
|addressed to the person summoned at |_|the person's|_|||his or |
|her||usual place of abode, at least 3 days before the time |
|stated in the summons for appearance; or (iii) leaving a |
|copy of the summons and petition with the guardian or |
|custodian of a minor, at least 3 days before the time |
|stated in the summons for appearance. If the guardian or |
|legal custodian is an agency of the State of Illinois, |
|proper service may be made by leaving a copy of the summons |

|and petition with any administrative employee of the |
|agency designated by the agency to accept the service of |
|summons and petitions. The certificate of the officer or |
|affidavit of the person that |_|the officer or person|_|||he or |
|she||has sent the copy pursuant to this Section is |
|sufficient proof of service.|||||
|||||(f) When a parent or other person, who has signed a |
|written promise to appear and bring the minor to court or |
|who has waived or acknowledged service, fails to appear |
|with the minor on the date set by the court, a bench |
|warrant may be issued for the parent or other person, the |
|minor, or both.|||
|||(2) Service by certified mail or publication.|||||
|||||(a) If service on individuals as provided in |
|subsection (1) is not made on any respondent within a |
|reasonable time or if it appears that any respondent |
|resides outside the State, service may be made by |
|certified mail. In that case the clerk shall mail the |
|summons and a copy of the petition to that respondent by |
|certified mail marked for delivery to addressee only. The |
|court shall not proceed with the adjudicatory hearing |
|until 5 days after the mailing. The regular return receipt |
|for certified mail is sufficient proof of service.|||||
|||||(b) If service upon individuals as provided in |
|subsection (1) is not made on any respondents within a |
|reasonable time or if any person is made a respondent |

|under the designation of "All Whom It May Concern", or if |
|service cannot be made because the whereabouts of a |
|respondent are unknown, service may be made by |
|publication. The clerk of the court as soon as possible |
|shall cause publication to be made once in a newspaper of |
|general circulation in the county where the action is |
|pending. Service by publication is not required in any |
|case when the person alleged to have legal custody of the |
|minor has been served with summons personally or by |
|certified mail, but the court may not enter any order or |
|judgment against any person who cannot be served with |
|process other than by publication unless service by |
|publication is given or unless that person appears. |
|Failure to provide service by publication to a |
|non-custodial parent whose whereabouts are unknown shall |
|not deprive the court of jurisdiction to proceed with a |
|trial or a plea of delinquency by the minor. When a minor |
|has been detained or sheltered under Section 5-501 of this |
|Act and summons has not been served personally or by |
|certified mail within 20 days from the date of the order of |
|court directing such detention or shelter care, the clerk |
|of the court shall cause publication. Service by |
|publication shall be substantially as follows:|||||
|||||||"A, B, C, D, (here giving the names of the named |
|respondents, if any) and to All Whom It May Concern (if |
|there is any respondent under that designation):|||||

|||||||Take notice that on (insert date) a petition was |
|filed under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 by .... in |
|the circuit court of .... county entitled 'In the |
|interest of ...., a minor', and that in .... courtroom |
|at .... on (insert date) at the hour of ...., or as |
|soon thereafter as this cause may be heard, an |
|adjudicatory hearing will be held upon the petition to |
|have the child declared to be a ward of the court under |
|that Act. The court has authority in this proceeding |
|to take from you the custody and guardianship of the |
|minor.|||||
|||||||Now, unless you appear at the hearing and show |
|cause against the petition, the allegations of the |
|petition may stand admitted as against you and each of |
|you, and an order or judgment entered.|||
|||||||........................................ |
|||||||Clerk |
|||||||Dated (insert the date of publication)"|||||
|||||(c) The clerk shall also at the time of the |
|publication of the notice send a copy of the notice by mail |
|to each of the respondents on account of whom publication |
|is made at |_|each respondent's|_|||his or her||last known |
|address. The certificate of the clerk that |_|the clerk|_|||he or |
|she||has mailed the notice is evidence of that mailing. No |
|other publication notice is required. Every respondent |
|notified by publication under this Section must appear and |

|answer in open court at the hearing. The court may not |
|proceed with the adjudicatory hearing until 10 days after |
|service by publication on any custodial parent, guardian |
|or legal custodian of a minor alleged to be delinquent.|||||
|||||(d) If it becomes necessary to change the date set for |
|the hearing in order to comply with this Section, notice |
|of the resetting of the date must be given, by certified |
|mail or other reasonable means, to each respondent who has |
|been served with summons personally or by certified mail.|||||
|||||(3) Once jurisdiction has been established over a |
|party, further service is not required and notice of any |
|subsequent proceedings in that prosecution shall be made |
|in accordance with provisions of Section 5-530.|||||
|||||(4) The appearance of the minor's parent, guardian or |
|legal custodian, or a person named as a respondent in a |
|petition, in any proceeding under this Act shall |
|constitute a waiver of service and submission to the |
|jurisdiction of the court. A copy of the petition shall be |
|provided to the person at the time of |_|the person's|_|||his or |
|her||appearance.|||

|Supreme Court Rule.|||
|||||||(i) A party or attorney electing to serve pleading |
|by facsimile must include on the certificate of |
|service transmitted the telephone number of the |
|sender's facsimile transmitting device. Use of service |
|by facsimile shall be deemed consent by that party or |
|attorney to receive service by facsimile transmission. |
|Any party may rescind consent of service by facsimile |

|when the State, without success, has exercised due diligence |

|petitions pending against |_|the minor|_|||him or her||in the same |
|county and simultaneously demands a trial upon more than one |
|delinquency petition pending against |_|the minor|_|||him or her||in |

|have a finding, after waiver of trial, upon at least one such |
|petition before expiration relative to any of the pending |

|under Section 5-620 of this Article, or, if the trial upon the |

|the first petition within a reasonable time, the minor shall |
|receive a trial upon all of the remaining petitions within 160 |
|days from the date on which the trial, or finding after waiver |
|of trial, on the first petition is concluded. If either such |
|period of 160 days expires without the commencement of trial, |
|or adjudication after waiver of trial, of any of the remaining |
|pending petitions, the petition or petitions shall be |
|dismissed and barred for want of prosecution unless the delay |
|is occasioned by any of the reasons described in this Section.|||
|||(3) When no such trial is held within the time required by |
|subsections (1) and (2) of this Section, the court shall, upon |
|motion by any party, dismiss the petition with prejudice.|||
|||(4) Without affecting the applicability of the tolling and |
|multiple prosecution provisions of subsections (8) and (2) of |
|this Section when a petition has been filed alleging that the |

|court may, upon motion of the State, continue the trial for |
|receipt of a confirmatory laboratory report for up to 45 days |
|after the date of the order directing detention or shelter |

|pursuant to subsection (4), shall be extended an additional 30 |

|jurisdiction.|||
|||(8) The period in which a trial shall be held as prescribed |
|by subsections (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7) of this |

|where the right to trial by jury is specifically set forth. At |
|any time a minor may waive |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||right to |
|trial by jury.|||
|||(2) Pleas of guilty and guilty but mentally ill.|||||

|accepted when the court has informed the minor of the |
|consequences of |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||plea and of the |
|maximum penalty provided by law which may be imposed upon |
|acceptance of the plea. Upon acceptance of a plea of |
|guilty, the court shall determine the factual basis of a |
|plea.|||||
|||||(b) Before or during trial, a plea of guilty but |
|mentally ill may be accepted by the court when:|||||
|||||||(i) the minor has undergone an examination by a |

|clinical psychologist or psychiatrist and has waived |
_|the minor's|_|||his or her||right to trial; and|||||

|psychological report or reports; and|||||

|minor's mental health and, at the conclusion of the |
|hearing, is satisfied that there is a factual basis |
|that the minor was mentally ill at the time of the |
|offense to which the plea is entered.|||
|||(3) Trial by the court.|||||
|||||(a) A trial shall be conducted in the presence of the |
|minor unless |_|the minor|_|||he or she||waives the right to be |
|present. At the trial, the court shall consider the |
|question whether the minor is delinquent. The standard of |
|proof and the rules of evidence in the nature of criminal |
|proceedings in this State are applicable to that |
|consideration.|||||
|||||(b) Upon conclusion of the trial the court shall enter |
|a general finding, except that, when the affirmative |
|defense of insanity has been presented during the trial |
|and acquittal is based solely upon the defense of |
|insanity, the court shall enter a finding of not guilty by |
|reason of insanity. In the event of a finding of not guilty |
|by reason of insanity, a hearing shall be held pursuant to |
|the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code to |

|determine whether the minor is subject to involuntary |
|admission.|||||
|||||(c) When the minor has asserted a defense of insanity, |
|the court may find the minor guilty but mentally ill if, |
|after hearing all of the evidence, the court finds that:|||||
|||||||(i) the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt |
|that the minor is guilty of the offense charged; and|||||
|||||||(ii) the minor has failed to prove |_|the minor's|_|||his |
|or her||insanity as required in subsection (b) of |
|Section 3-2 of the Criminal Code of 2012, and |
|subsections (a), (b) and (e) of Section 6-2 of the |
|Criminal Code of 2012; and|||||
|||||||(iii) the minor has proven by a preponderance of |
|the evidence that |_|the minor|_|||he||was mentally ill, as |
|defined in subsections (c) and (d) of Section 6-2 of |
|the Criminal Code of 2012 at the time of the offense.|||
|||(4) Trial by court and jury.|||||
|||||(a) Questions of law shall be decided by the court and |
|questions of fact by the jury.|||||
|||||(b) The jury shall consist of 12 members.|||||
|||||(c) Upon request the parties shall be furnished with a |
|list of prospective jurors with their addresses if known.|||||
|||||(d) Each party may challenge jurors for cause. If a |
|prospective juror has a physical impairment, the court |
|shall consider the prospective juror's ability to perceive |
|and appreciate the evidence when considering a challenge |

|for cause.|||||
|||||(e) A minor tried alone shall be allowed 7 peremptory |
|challenges; except that, in a single trial of more than |
|one minor, each minor shall be allowed 5 peremptory |
|challenges. If several charges against a minor or minors |
|are consolidated for trial, each minor shall be allowed |
|peremptory challenges upon one charge only, which single |
|charge shall be the charge against that minor authorizing |
|the greatest maximum penalty. The State shall be allowed |
|the same number of peremptory challenges as all of the |
|minors.|||||
|||||(f) After examination by the court, the jurors may be |
|examined, passed upon, accepted and tendered by opposing |
|counsel as provided by Supreme Court Rules.|||||
|||||(g) After the jury is impaneled and sworn, the court |
|may direct the selection of 2 alternate jurors who shall |
|take the same oath as the regular jurors. Each party shall |
|have one additional peremptory challenge for each |
|alternate juror. If before the final submission of a cause |
|a member of the jury dies or is discharged, |_|the member|_|||he |
|or she||shall be replaced by an alternate juror in the order |
|of selection.|||||
|||||(h) A trial by the court and jury shall be conducted in |
|the presence of the minor unless |_|the minor|_|||he or she||waives |
|the right to be present.|||||
|||||(i) After arguments of counsel the court shall |

|instruct the jury as to the law.|||||
|||||(j) Unless the affirmative defense of insanity has |
|been presented during the trial, the jury shall return a |
|general verdict as to each offense charged. When the |
|affirmative defense of insanity has been presented during |
|the trial, the court shall provide the jury not only with |
|general verdict forms but also with a special verdict form |
|of not guilty by reason of insanity, as to each offense |
|charged, and in the event the court shall separately |
|instruct the jury that a special verdict of not guilty by |
|reason of insanity may be returned instead of a general |
|verdict but the special verdict requires a unanimous |
|finding by the jury that the minor committed the acts |
|charged but at the time of the commission of those acts the |
|minor was insane. In the event of a verdict of not guilty |
|by reason of insanity, a hearing shall be held pursuant to |
|the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code to |
|determine whether the minor is subject to involuntary |
|admission. When the affirmative defense of insanity has |
|been presented during the trial, the court, where |
|warranted by the evidence, shall also provide the jury |
|with a special verdict form of guilty but mentally ill, as |
|to each offense charged and shall separately instruct the |
|jury that a special verdict of guilty but mentally ill may |
|be returned instead of a general verdict, but that the |
|special verdict requires a unanimous finding by the jury |

|that: (i) the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt |

|furtherance of the activities of an organized gang or was |
|motivated by the minor's membership in or allegiance to an |

|||Sec. 5-625. ||Absence of minor. |||
|||(1) When a minor after arrest and an initial court |
|appearance for a felony, fails to appear for trial, at the |
|request of the State and after the State has affirmatively |
|proven through substantial evidence that the minor is |
|willfully avoiding trial, the court may commence trial in the |
|absence of the minor. The absent minor must be represented by |
|retained or appointed counsel. If trial had previously |
|commenced in the presence of the minor and the minor |_|is|_||

|willfully |_|absent|_|||absents himself||for 2 successive court days, |
|the court shall proceed to trial. All procedural rights |
|guaranteed by the United States Constitution, Constitution of |
|the State of Illinois, statutes of the State of Illinois, and |
|rules of court shall apply to the proceedings the same as if |
|the minor were present in court. The court may set the case for |
|a trial which may be conducted under this Section despite the |
|failure of the minor to appear at the hearing at which the |
|trial date is set. When the trial date is set the clerk shall |
|send to the minor, by certified mail at |_|the minor's|_|||his or her|||
|last known address, notice of the new date which has been set |
|for trial. The notification shall be required when the minor |
|was not personally present in open court at the time when the |
|case was set for trial.|||
|||(2) The absence of the minor from a trial conducted under |
|this Section does not operate as a bar to concluding the trial, |
|to a finding of guilty resulting from the trial, or to a final |
|disposition of the trial in favor of the minor.|||
|||(3) Upon a finding or verdict of not guilty the court shall |
|enter |_|a|_|finding for the minor. Upon a finding or verdict of |
|guilty, the court shall set a date for the hearing of |
|post-trial motions and shall hear the motion in the absence of |
|the minor. If post-trial motions are denied, the court shall |
|proceed to conduct a sentencing hearing and to impose a |
|sentence upon the minor. A social investigation is waived if |
|the minor is absent.|||

|||(4) A minor who is absent for part of the proceedings of |
|trial, post-trial motions, or sentencing, does not thereby |
|forfeit |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||right to be present at all |
|remaining proceedings.|||
|||(5) When a minor who in |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||absence has |
|been either found guilty or sentenced or both found guilty and |
|sentenced appears before the court, |_|the minor|_|||he or she||must be |
|granted a new trial or a new sentencing hearing if the minor |
|can establish that |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||failure to appear in |
|court was both without |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||fault and due to |
|circumstances beyond |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||control. A hearing |
|with notice to the State's Attorney on the minors request for a |
|new trial or a new sentencing hearing must be held before any |
|such request may be granted. At any such hearing both the minor |
|and the State may present evidence.|||
|||(6) If the court grants only the minor's request for a new |
|sentencing hearing, then a new sentencing hearing shall be |
|held in accordance with the provisions of this Article. At any |
|such hearing, both the minor and the State may offer evidence |
|of the minor's conduct during |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||period of |

|juvenile jurisdiction prosecution the Unified Code of |
|Corrections and is not in any way limited or restricted by any |
|sentence previously imposed.|||

|sentencing hearing, the court shall determine whether it is in |
|the best interests of the minor or the public that |_|the minor|_|||he |
|or she||be made a ward of the court, and, if |_|the minor|_|||he or she|||
|is to be made a ward of the court, the court shall determine |
|the proper disposition best serving the interests of the minor |
|and the public. All evidence helpful in determining these |
|questions, including oral and written reports, may be admitted |
|and may be relied upon to the extent of its probative value, |
|even though not competent for the purposes of the trial. A |
|crime victim shall be allowed to present an oral or written |
|statement, as guaranteed by Article I, Section 8.1 of the |
|Illinois Constitution and as provided in Section 6 of the |
|Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, in any case in |
|which: (a) a juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent for a |
|violent crime after a bench or jury trial; or (b) the petition |

|alleged the commission of a violent crime and the juvenile has |
|been adjudicated delinquent under a plea agreement of a crime |
|that is not a violent crime. The court shall allow a victim to |
|make an oral statement if the victim is present in the |
|courtroom and requests to make an oral statement. An oral |
|statement includes the victim or a representative of the |
|victim reading the written statement. The court may allow |
|persons impacted by the crime who are not victims under |
|subsection (a) of Section 3 of the Rights of Crime Victims and |
|Witnesses Act to present an oral or written statement. A |
|victim and any person making an oral statement shall not be put |
|under oath or subject to cross-examination. A record of a |
|prior continuance under supervision under Section 5-615, |
|whether successfully completed or not, is admissible at the |
|sentencing hearing. No order of commitment to the Department |
|of Juvenile Justice shall be entered against a minor before a |
|written report of social investigation, which has been |
|completed within the previous 60 days, is presented to and |
|considered by the court.|||
|||(2) Once a party has been served in compliance with |
|Section 5-525, no further service or notice must be given to |
|that party prior to proceeding to a sentencing hearing. Before |
|imposing sentence the court shall advise the State's Attorney |
|and the parties who are present or their counsel of the factual |
|contents and the conclusions of the reports prepared for the |
|use of the court and considered by it, and afford fair |

|opportunity, if requested, to controvert them. Factual |
|contents, conclusions, documents and sources disclosed by the |
|court under this paragraph shall not be further disclosed |
|without the express approval of the court.|||
|||(3) On its own motion or that of the State's Attorney, a |
|parent, guardian, legal custodian, or counsel, the court may |
|adjourn the hearing for a reasonable period to receive reports |
|or other evidence and, in such event, shall make an |
|appropriate order for detention of the minor or |_|the minor's|_||
|his or her||release from detention subject to supervision by |
|the court during the period of the continuance. In the event |
|the court shall order detention hereunder, the period of the |
|continuance shall not exceed 30 court days. At the end of such |
|time, the court shall release the minor from detention unless |
|notice is served at least 3 days prior to the hearing on the |
|continued date that the State will be seeking an extension of |
|the period of detention, which notice shall state the reason |
|for the request for the extension. The extension of detention |
|may be for a maximum period of an additional 15 court days or a |
|lesser number of days at the discretion of the court. However, |
|at the expiration of the period of extension, the court shall |
|release the minor from detention if a further continuance is |
|granted. In scheduling investigations and hearings, the court |
|shall give priority to proceedings in which a minor is in |
|detention or has otherwise been removed from |_|the minor's|_|||his |
|or her||home before a sentencing order has been made. |||

|||(4) When commitment to the Department of Juvenile Justice |
|is ordered, the court shall state the basis for selecting the |
|particular disposition, and the court shall prepare such a |
|statement for inclusion in the record.|||
|||(5) Before a sentencing order is entered by the court |
|under Section 5-710 for a minor adjudged delinquent for a |
|violation of paragraph (3.5) of subsection (a) of Section 26-1 |
|of the Criminal Code of 2012, in which the minor made a threat |
|of violence, death, or bodily harm against a person, school, |
|school function, or school event, the court may order a mental |
|health evaluation of the minor by a physician, clinical |
|psychologist, or qualified examiner, whether employed by the |
|State, by any public or private mental health facility or part |
|of the facility, or by any public or private medical facility |
|or part of the facility. A statement made by a minor during the |
|course of a mental health evaluation conducted under this |
|subsection (5) is not admissible on the issue of delinquency |
|during the course of an adjudicatory hearing held under this |
|Act. Neither the physician, clinical psychologist, qualified |

|30 days, either as the exclusive order of disposition |
|or, where appropriate, in conjunction with any other |
|order of disposition issued under this paragraph, |
|provided that any such detention shall be in a |
|juvenile detention home and the minor so detained |
|shall be 10 years of age or older. However, the 30-day |
|limitation may be extended by further order of the |
|court for a minor under age 15 committed to the |
|Department of Children and Family Services if the |
|court finds that the minor is a danger to |_|the minor|_||

|himself||or others. The minor shall be given credit on |
|the sentencing order of detention for time spent in |
|detention under Sections 5-501, 5-601, 5-710, or 5-720 |
|of this Article as a result of the offense for which |
|the sentencing order was imposed. The court may grant |
|credit on a sentencing order of detention entered |
|under a violation of probation or violation of |
|conditional discharge under Section 5-720 of this |
|Article for time spent in detention before the filing |
|of the petition alleging the violation. A minor shall |
|not be deprived of credit for time spent in detention |
|before the filing of a violation of probation or |
|conditional discharge alleging the same or related act |
|or acts. The limitation that the minor shall only be |
|placed in a juvenile detention home does not apply as |
|follows:|
|||||||Persons 18 years of age and older who have a |

|against the person, these factors, among other |
|matters, shall be considered:|
|||||||||(A) the age of the person;|

|detention under Part 7A of this Article.|||
|||||(b) A minor found to be guilty may be committed to the |
|Department of Juvenile Justice under Section 5-750 if the |
|minor is at least 13 years and under 20 years of age, |
|provided that the commitment to the Department of Juvenile |
|Justice shall be made only if the minor was found guilty of |
|a felony offense or first degree murder. The court shall |
|include in the sentencing order any pre-custody credits |
|the minor is entitled to under Section 5-4.5-100 of the |
|Unified Code of Corrections. The time during which a minor |
|is in custody before being released upon the request of a |
|parent, guardian or legal custodian shall also be |
|considered as time spent in custody.|||
|||||(c) When a minor is found to be guilty for an offense |
|which is a violation of the Illinois Controlled Substances |
|Act, the Cannabis Control Act, or the Methamphetamine |
|Control and Community Protection Act and made a ward of |
|the court, the court may enter a disposition order |
|requiring the minor to undergo assessment, counseling or |
|treatment in a substance use disorder treatment program |
|approved by the Department of Human Services.|||
|||(2) Any sentencing order other than commitment to the |
|Department of Juvenile Justice may provide for protective |
|supervision under Section 5-725 and may include an order of |
|protection under Section 5-730.|||
|||(3) Unless the sentencing order expressly so provides, it |

|does not operate to close proceedings on the pending petition, |
|but is subject to modification until final closing and |
|discharge of the proceedings under Section 5-750.|||
|||(4) In addition to any other sentence, the court may order |
|any minor found to be delinquent to make restitution, in |
|monetary or non-monetary form, under the terms and conditions |
|of Section 5-5-6 of the Unified Code of Corrections, except |
|that the "presentencing hearing" referred to in that Section |
|shall be the sentencing hearing for purposes of this Section. |
|The parent, guardian or legal custodian of the minor may be |
|ordered by the court to pay some or all of the restitution on |
|the minor's behalf, pursuant to the Parental Responsibility |
|Law. The State's Attorney is authorized to act on behalf of any |
|victim in seeking restitution in proceedings under this |
|Section, up to the maximum amount allowed in Section 5 of the |
|Parental Responsibility Law.|||
|||(5) Any sentencing order where the minor is committed or |
|placed in accordance with Section 5-740 shall provide for the |
|parents or guardian of the estate of the minor to pay to the |
|legal custodian or guardian of the person of the minor such |
|sums as are determined by the custodian or guardian of the |
|person of the minor as necessary for the minor's needs. The |
|payments may not exceed the maximum amounts provided for by |
|Section 9.1 of the Children and Family Services Act.|||
|||(6) Whenever the sentencing order requires the minor to |
|attend school or participate in a program of training, the |

|truant officer or designated school official shall regularly |
|report to the court if the minor is a chronic or habitual |
|truant under Section 26-2a of the School Code. Notwithstanding |
|any other provision of this Act, in instances in which |
|educational services are to be provided to a minor in a |
|residential facility where the minor has been placed by the |
|court, costs incurred in the provision of those educational |
|services must be allocated based on the requirements of the |
|School Code. |||
|||(7) In no event shall a guilty minor be committed to the |
|Department of Juvenile Justice for a period of time in excess |
|of that period for which an adult could be committed for the |
|same act. The court shall include in the sentencing order a |
|limitation on the period of confinement not to exceed the |
|maximum period of imprisonment the court could impose under |
|Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections. |||
|||(7.5) In no event shall a guilty minor be committed to the |
|Department of Juvenile Justice or placed in detention when the |
|act for which the minor was adjudicated delinquent would not |
|be illegal if committed by an adult. |

|Department of Juvenile Justice for an offense which is a Class |
|4 felony under Section 19-4 (criminal trespass to a |
|residence), 21-1 (criminal damage to property), 21-1.01 |
|(criminal damage to government supported property), 21-1.3 |
|(criminal defacement of property), 26-1 (disorderly conduct), |

|or 31-4 (obstructing justice) of the Criminal Code of 2012. |
|||(7.75) In no event shall a guilty minor be committed to the |
|Department of Juvenile Justice for an offense that is a Class 3 |
|or Class 4 felony violation of the Illinois Controlled |
|Substances Act unless the commitment occurs upon a third or |
|subsequent judicial finding of a violation of probation for |
|substantial noncompliance with court-ordered treatment or |
|programming.|
|||(8) A minor found to be guilty for reasons that include a |
|violation of Section 21-1.3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the |
|Criminal Code of 2012 shall be ordered to perform community |
|service for not less than 30 and not more than 120 hours, if |
|community service is available in the jurisdiction. The |
|community service shall include, but need not be limited to, |
|the cleanup and repair of the damage that was caused by the |
|violation or similar damage to property located in the |
|municipality or county in which the violation occurred. The |
|order may be in addition to any other order authorized by this |
|Section.|||
|||(8.5) A minor found to be guilty for reasons that include a |
|violation of Section 3.02 or Section 3.03 of the Humane Care |
|for Animals Act or paragraph (d) of subsection (1) of Section |
|21-1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or paragraph (4) of |
|subsection (a) of Section 21-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012 |
|shall be ordered to undergo medical or psychiatric treatment |
|rendered by a psychiatrist or psychological treatment rendered |

|by a clinical psychologist. The order may be in addition to any |
|other order authorized by this Section.|||
|||(9) In addition to any other sentencing order, the court |
|shall order any minor found to be guilty for an act which would |
|constitute, predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, |
|aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual assault, |
|aggravated criminal sexual abuse, or criminal sexual abuse if |
|committed by an adult to undergo medical testing to determine |
|whether the defendant has any sexually transmissible disease |
|including a test for infection with human immunodeficiency |
|virus (HIV) or any other identified causative agency of |
|acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Any medical test |
|shall be performed only by appropriately licensed medical |
|practitioners and may include an analysis of any bodily fluids |
|as well as an examination of the minor's person. Except as |
|otherwise provided by law, the results of the test shall be |
|kept strictly confidential by all medical personnel involved |
|in the testing and must be personally delivered in a sealed |
|envelope to the judge of the court in which the sentencing |
|order was entered for the judge's inspection in camera. Acting |
|in accordance with the best interests of the victim and the |
|public, the judge shall have the discretion to determine to |
|whom the results of the testing may be revealed. The court |
|shall notify the minor of the results of the test for infection |
|with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The court shall |
|also notify the victim if requested by the victim, and if the |

|victim is under the age of 15 and if requested by the victim's |
|parents or legal guardian, the court shall notify the victim's |
|parents or the legal guardian, of the results of the test for |
|infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The |
|court shall provide information on the availability of HIV |
|testing and counseling at the Department of Public Health |
|facilities to all parties to whom the results of the testing |
|are revealed. The court shall order that the cost of any test |
|shall be paid by the county and may be taxed as costs against |
|the minor.|||
|||(10) When a court finds a minor to be guilty the court |
|shall, before entering a sentencing order under this Section, |
|make a finding whether the offense committed either: (a) was |
|related to or in furtherance of the criminal activities of an |
|organized gang or was motivated by the minor's membership in |
|or allegiance to an organized gang, or (b) involved a |
|violation of subsection (a) of Section 12-7.1 of the Criminal |
|Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, a violation of any |
|Section of Article 24 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the |
|Criminal Code of 2012, or a violation of any statute that |
|involved the wrongful use of a firearm. If the court |
|determines the question in the affirmative, and the court does |
|not commit the minor to the Department of Juvenile Justice, |
|the court shall order the minor to perform community service |
|for not less than 30 hours nor more than 120 hours, provided |
|that community service is available in the jurisdiction and is |

|funded and approved by the county board of the county where the |
|offense was committed. The community service shall include, |
|but need not be limited to, the cleanup and repair of any |
|damage caused by a violation of Section 21-1.3 of the Criminal |
|Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 and similar damage to |
|property located in the municipality or county in which the |
|violation occurred. When possible and reasonable, the |
|community service shall be performed in the minor's |
|neighborhood. This order shall be in addition to any other |
|order authorized by this Section except for an order to place |
|the minor in the custody of the Department of Juvenile |
|Justice. For the purposes of this Section, "organized gang" |
|has the meaning ascribed to it in Section 10 of the Illinois |
|Streetgang Terrorism Omnibus Prevention Act.|||
|||(11) If the court determines that the offense was |
|committed in furtherance of the criminal activities of an |
|organized gang, as provided in subsection (10), and that the |
|offense involved the operation or use of a motor vehicle or the |
|use of a driver's license or permit, the court shall notify the |
|Secretary of State of that determination and of the period for |
|which the minor shall be denied driving privileges. If, at the |
|time of the determination, the minor does not hold a driver's |
|license or permit, the court shall provide that the minor |
|shall not be issued a driver's license or permit until |_|the |_
_|minor's|_|||his or her||18th birthday. If the minor holds a driver's |
|license or permit at the time of the determination, the court |

|shall provide that the minor's driver's license or permit |
|shall be revoked until |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||21st birthday, or |
|until a later date or occurrence determined by the court. If |
|the minor holds a driver's license at the time of the |
|determination, the court may direct the Secretary of State to |
|issue the minor a judicial driving permit, also known as a JDP. |
|The JDP shall be subject to the same terms as a JDP issued |
|under Section 6-206.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, except |
|that the court may direct that the JDP be effective |
|immediately. |

|||(a) Any minor who is placed in the guardianship of the |
|Department of Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 |
|while an application for the Family Support Program was |
|pending with the Department of Healthcare and Family Services |
|or an active application was being reviewed by the Department |
|of Healthcare and Family Services shall continue to be |
|considered eligible for services if all other eligibility |
|criteria are met.|
|||(b) The court shall conduct a hearing within 14 days upon |
|notification to all parties that an application for the Family |

|Support Program services has been approved and services are |
|available. At the hearing, the court shall determine whether |
|to vacate guardianship of the Department of Children and |
|Family Services and return the minor to the custody of the |
|parent or guardian with Family Support Program services or |
|whether the minor shall continue in the guardianship of the |
|Department of Children and Family Services and decline the |
|Family Support Program services. In making its determination, |
|the court shall consider the minor's best interest, the |
|involvement of the parent or guardian in proceedings under |
|this Act, the involvement of the parent or guardian in the |
|minor's treatment, the relationship between the minor and the |
|parent or guardian, and any other factor the court deems |
|relevant. If the court vacates the guardianship of the |
|Department of Children and Family Services and returns the |
|minor to the custody of the parent or guardian with Family |
|Support Services, the Department of Healthcare and Family |
|Services shall become financially responsible for providing |
|services to the minor. If the court determines that the minor |
|shall continue in the custody of the Department of Children |
|and Family Services, the Department of Children and Family |
|Services shall remain financially responsible for providing |
|services to the minor, the Family Support Services shall be |
|declined, and the minor shall no longer be eligible for Family |
|Support Services. |
|||(c) This Section does not apply to a minor:|

|||||(1) for whom a petition has been filed under this Act |
|alleging that |_|the minor|_|||he or she||is an abused or neglected |
|minor;|
|||||(2) for whom the court has made a finding that |_|the |_

|not exceed 5 years or until the minor has attained the age of |
|21 years, whichever is less, except as provided in this |
|Section for a minor who is found to be guilty for an offense |
|which is first degree murder. The juvenile court may terminate |
|probation or conditional discharge and discharge the minor at |
|any time if warranted by the conduct of the minor and the ends |
|of justice; provided, however, that the period of probation |

|for a minor who is found to be guilty for an offense which is |
|first degree murder shall be at least 5 years. |||
|||(1.5) The period of probation for a minor who is found |
|guilty of aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual |
|assault, or aggravated battery with a firearm shall be at |
|least 36 months. The period of probation for a minor who is |
|found to be guilty of any other Class X felony shall be at |
|least 24 months. The period of probation for a Class 1 or Class |
|2 forcible felony shall be at least 18 months. Regardless of |
|the length of probation ordered by the court, for all offenses |
|under this paragraph (1.5), the court shall schedule hearings |
|to determine whether it is in the best interest of the minor |
|and public safety to terminate probation after the minimum |
|period of probation has been served. In such a hearing, there |
|shall be a rebuttable presumption that it is in the best |
|interest of the minor and public safety to terminate |
|probation.|
|||(2) The court may as a condition of probation or of |
|conditional discharge require that the minor: |||

|minor has been placed on probation, or advance approval by |
|the court, if the minor has been placed on conditional |

|conditional discharge require that a minor found guilty on any |
|alcohol, cannabis, methamphetamine, or controlled substance |
|violation, refrain from acquiring a driver's license during |

|the period of probation or conditional discharge. If the minor |
|is in possession of a permit or license, the court may require |
|that the minor refrain from driving or operating any motor |
|vehicle during the period of probation or conditional |
|discharge, except as may be necessary in the course of the |
|minor's lawful employment. |||
|||(3.5) The court shall, as a condition of probation or of |
|conditional discharge, require that a minor found to be guilty |

|provider approved by the Board. The treatment shall be at the |
|expense of the person evaluated based upon that person's |
|ability to pay for the treatment. |||
|||(4) A minor on probation or conditional discharge shall be |
|given a certificate setting forth the conditions upon which |

_|the minor|_|||he or she||is being released. |||
|||(5) The court shall impose upon a minor placed on |
|probation or conditional discharge, as a condition of the |
|probation or conditional discharge, a fee of $50 for each |
|month of probation or conditional discharge supervision |
|ordered by the court, unless after determining the inability |
|of the minor placed on probation or conditional discharge to |
|pay the fee, the court assesses a lesser amount. The court may |
|not impose the fee on a minor who is placed in the guardianship |
|or custody of the Department of Children and Family Services |
|under this Act while the minor is in placement. The fee shall |
|be imposed only upon a minor who is actively supervised by the |
|probation and court services department. The court may order |
|the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the minor to pay |
|some or all of the fee on the minor's behalf. |||
|||(5.5) Jurisdiction over an offender may be transferred |
|from the sentencing court to the court of another circuit with |
|the concurrence of both courts. Further transfers or |
|retransfers of jurisdiction are also authorized in the same |
|manner. The court to which jurisdiction has been transferred |
|shall have the same powers as the sentencing court. The |
|probation department within the circuit to which jurisdiction |
|has been transferred, or which has agreed to provide |
|supervision, may impose probation fees upon receiving the |
|transferred offender, as provided in subsection (i) of Section |
|5-6-3 of the Unified Code of Corrections. For all transfer |

|cases, as defined in Section 9b of the Probation and Probation |
|Officers Act, the probation department from the original |
|sentencing court shall retain all probation fees collected |
|prior to the transfer. After the transfer, all probation fees |
|shall be paid to the probation department within the circuit |
|to which jurisdiction has been transferred. |
|||If the transfer case originated in another state and has |
|been transferred under the Interstate Compact for Juveniles to |
|the jurisdiction of an Illinois circuit court for supervision |
|by an Illinois probation department, probation fees may be |
|imposed only if permitted by the Interstate Commission for |
|Juveniles. |
|||(6) The General Assembly finds that in order to protect |
|the public, the juvenile justice system must compel compliance |
|with the conditions of probation by responding to violations |
|with swift, certain, and fair punishments and intermediate |
|sanctions. The Chief Judge of each circuit shall adopt a |
|system of structured, intermediate sanctions for violations of |
|the terms and conditions of a sentence of supervision, |
|probation or conditional discharge, under this Act. |||
|||The court shall provide as a condition of a disposition of |
|probation, conditional discharge, or supervision, that the |
|probation agency may invoke any sanction from the list of |
|intermediate sanctions adopted by the chief judge of the |
|circuit court for violations of the terms and conditions of |
|the sentence of probation, conditional discharge, or |

|supervision, subject to the provisions of Section 5-720 of |
|this Act. |||

|may serve on the minor a notice of intermediate sanctions. The |
|notice shall contain the technical violation or violations |

|shelter care or detention hearing, if the court finds that the |
|person against whom the protective order is being sought has |
|been notified of the hearing or that diligent efforts have |
|been made to notify the person, the court may conduct a |

|unfit or are unable, for some reason other than financial |
|circumstances alone, to care for, protect, train or discipline |
|the minor or are unwilling to do so, and that appropriate |
|services aimed at family preservation and family reunification |
|have been unsuccessful in rectifying the conditions which have |
|led to a finding of unfitness or inability to care for, |

|best interest of the minor to take |_|the minor|_|||him or her||from |
|the custody of |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||parents, guardian or |

|persons of like religious faith of the minor and shall require |
|the Department of Children and Family Services to otherwise |
|comply with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act |
|in placing the child. In addition, whenever alternative plans |
|for placement are available, the court shall ascertain and |
|consider, to the extent appropriate in the particular case, |

|the views and preferences of the minor.|||
|||(3) When a minor is placed with a suitable relative or |
|other person, the court shall appoint |_|the suitable relative or |_
_|other person|_|||him or her||the legal custodian or guardian of the |
|person of the minor. When a minor is committed to any agency, |
|the court shall appoint the proper officer or representative |
|of the proper officer as legal custodian or guardian of the |
|person of the minor. Legal custodians and guardians of the |
|person of the minor have the respective rights and duties set |
|forth in subsection (9) of Section 5-105 except as otherwise |
|provided by order of court; but no guardian of the person may |
|consent to adoption of the minor. An agency whose |
|representative is appointed guardian of the person or legal |

|child care facility, but the facility must be licensed under |
|the Child Care Act of 1969 or have been approved by the |
|Department of Children and Family Services as meeting the |
|standards established for such licensing. Like authority and |
|restrictions shall be conferred by the court upon any |
|probation officer who has been appointed guardian of the |
|person of a minor.|||
|||(4) No placement by any probation officer or agency whose |
|representative is appointed guardian of the person or legal |
|custodian of a minor may be made in any out of State child care |

_|minor's|_|||his or her||parents, guardian or legal custodian are |
|unfit or are unable, for some reason other than financial |
|circumstances alone, to care for, protect, train or discipline |

|Justice is the least restrictive alternative based on evidence |
|that efforts were made to locate less restrictive alternatives |
|to secure confinement and the reasons why efforts were |

|secure confinement is necessary, following a review of the |
|following individualized factors: |
|||||(A) Age of the minor.|
|||||(B) Criminal background of the minor.|

|minor, indicating whether the minor has ever been |
|diagnosed with a health issue and if so what services were |
|provided and whether the minor was compliant with |
|services.|
|||||(F) Community based services that have been provided |

|of Juvenile Justice under this Act shall be eligible for |
|aftercare release without regard to the length of time the |
|minor has been confined or whether the minor has served any |
|minimum term imposed. Aftercare release shall be administered |
|by the Department of Juvenile Justice, under the direction of |

|the Director. Unless sooner discharged, the Department of |
|Juvenile Justice shall discharge a minor from aftercare |
|release upon completion of the following aftercare release |
|terms: |
|||||(a) One and a half years from the date a minor is |
|released from a Department facility, if the minor was |

|of Juvenile Justice a certified copy of the order, which |
|constitutes proof of the Director's authority. No other |

|||(1) (a) If the State's Attorney files a petition, at any |
|time prior to commencement of the minor's trial, to designate |
|the proceeding as an extended jurisdiction juvenile |
|prosecution and the petition alleges the commission by a minor |
|13 years of age or older of any offense which would be a felony |

|if committed by an adult, and, if the juvenile judge assigned |
|to hear and determine petitions to designate the proceeding as |
|an extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution determines that |
|there is probable cause to believe that the allegations in the |
|petition and motion are true, there is a rebuttable |
|presumption that the proceeding shall be designated as an |
|extended jurisdiction juvenile proceeding.|||
|||(b) The judge shall enter an order designating the |
|proceeding as an extended jurisdiction juvenile proceeding |
|unless the judge makes a finding based on clear and convincing |
|evidence that sentencing under the Chapter V of the Unified |
|Code of Corrections would not be appropriate for the minor |
|based on an evaluation of the following factors:|||
|||||(i) the age of the minor; |
|||||(ii) the history of the minor, including: |
|||||||(A) any previous delinquent or criminal history of |
|the minor, |
|||||||(B) any previous abuse or neglect history of the |
|minor, and |
|||||||(C) any mental health, physical and/or educational |
|history of the minor; |
|||||(iii) the circumstances of the offense, including: |
|||||||(A) the seriousness of the offense, |
|||||||(B) whether the minor is charged through |
|accountability, |
|||||||(C) whether there is evidence the offense was |

|committed in an aggressive and premeditated manner, |
|||||||(D) whether there is evidence the offense caused |
|serious bodily harm, |
|||||||(E) whether there is evidence the minor possessed |
|a deadly weapon; |
|||||(iv) the advantages of treatment within the juvenile |
|justice system including whether there are facilities or |
|programs, or both, particularly available in the juvenile |
|system; |
|||||(v) whether the security of the public requires |
|sentencing under Chapter V of the Unified Code of |
|Corrections: |
|||||||(A) the minor's history of services, including the |
|minor's willingness to participate meaningfully in |
|available services; |
|||||||(B) whether there is a reasonable likelihood that |
|the minor can be rehabilitated before the expiration |
|of the juvenile court's jurisdiction; |
|||||||(C) the adequacy of the punishment or services. |||
|||In considering these factors, the court shall give greater |
|weight to the seriousness of the alleged offense, and the |
|minor's prior record of delinquency than to other factors |
|listed in this subsection.|||
|||(2) Procedures for extended jurisdiction juvenile |
|prosecutions. The State's Attorney may file a written motion |
|for a proceeding to be designated as an extended juvenile |

|jurisdiction prior to commencement of trial. Notice of the |
|motion shall be in compliance with Section 5-530. When the |
|State's Attorney files a written motion that a proceeding be |
|designated an extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution, the |
|court shall commence a hearing within 30 days of the filing of |
|the motion for designation, unless good cause is shown by the |
|prosecution or the minor as to why the hearing could not be |
|held within this time period. If the court finds good cause has |
|been demonstrated, then the hearing shall be held within 60 |
|days of the filing of the motion. The hearings shall be open to |
|the public unless the judge finds that the hearing should be |
|closed for the protection of any party, victim or witness. If |
|the Juvenile Judge assigned to hear and determine a motion to |
|designate an extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution |
|determines that there is probable cause to believe that the |
|allegations in the petition and motion are true the court |
|shall grant the motion for designation. Information used by |
|the court in its findings or stated in or offered in connection |
|with this Section may be by way of proffer based on reliable |
|information offered by the State or the minor. All evidence |
|shall be admissible if it is relevant and reliable regardless |
|of whether it would be admissible under the rules of evidence. |||
|||(3) Trial. A minor who is subject of an extended |
|jurisdiction juvenile prosecution has the right to trial by |
|jury. Any trial under this Section shall be open to the public.|||
|||(4) Sentencing. If an extended jurisdiction juvenile |

|prosecution under subsection (1) results in a guilty plea, a |
|verdict of guilty, or a finding of guilt, the court shall |
|impose the following:|||
|||||(i) one or more juvenile sentences under Section |
|5-710; and|||
|||||(ii) an adult criminal sentence in accordance with the |
|provisions of Section 5-4.5-105 of the Unified Code of |
|Corrections, the execution of which shall be stayed on the |
|condition that the offender not violate the provisions of |
|the juvenile sentence.|||
|Any sentencing hearing under this Section shall be open to the |
|public.|||
|||(5) If, after an extended jurisdiction juvenile |
|prosecution trial, a minor is convicted of a lesser-included |
|offense or of an offense that the State's Attorney did not |
|designate as an extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution, |
|the State's Attorney may file a written motion, within 10 days |
|of the finding of guilt, that the minor be sentenced as an |
|extended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution offender. The court |
|shall rule on this motion using the factors found in paragraph |
|(1)(b) of Section 5-805. If the court denies the State's |
|Attorney's motion for sentencing under the extended |
|jurisdiction juvenile prosecution provision, the court shall |
|proceed to sentence the minor under Section 5-710.|||
|||(6) When it appears that a minor convicted in an extended |
|jurisdiction juvenile prosecution under subsection (1) has |

|violated the conditions of |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||sentence, or |
|is alleged to have committed a new offense upon the filing of a |
|petition to revoke the stay, the court may, without notice, |
|issue a warrant for the arrest of the minor. After a hearing, |
|if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the |
|minor committed a new offense, the court shall order execution |
|of the previously imposed adult criminal sentence. After a |
|hearing, if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence |
|that the minor committed a violation of |_|the minor's|_|||his or her|||
|sentence other than by a new offense, the court may order |
|execution of the previously imposed adult criminal sentence or |
|may continue |_|the minor|_|||him or her||on the existing juvenile |
|sentence with or without modifying or enlarging the |
|conditions. Upon revocation of the stay of the adult criminal |
|sentence and imposition of that sentence, the minor's extended |
|jurisdiction juvenile status shall be terminated. The on-going |
|jurisdiction over the minor's case shall be assumed by the |
|adult criminal court and juvenile court jurisdiction shall be |
|terminated and a report of the imposition of the adult |
|sentence shall be sent to the |_|Illinois|_|||Department of||State |
|Police.|||
|||(7) Upon successful completion of the juvenile sentence |
|the court shall vacate the adult criminal sentence.|||

|filing a motion for transfer under Section 5-805.|||

|subsection (a-3) or (a-5) of Section 12-7.3, paragraph (1) or |
|(2) of subsection (a) of Section 12-7.4, subparagraph (i) of |

|||(b) If the chief law enforcement officer of the agency, or |
_|the chief law enforcement officer's|_|||his or her||designee, |
|certifies in writing that certain information is needed for a |
|pending investigation involving the commission of a felony, |
|that information, and information identifying the juvenile, |
|may be retained in an intelligence file until the |
|investigation is terminated or for one additional year, |
|whichever is sooner. Retention of a portion of a juvenile's |
|juvenile law enforcement record does not disqualify the |
|remainder of |_|a juvenile's|_|||his or her||record from immediate |
|automatic expungement. |

|||(0.4) Automatic expungement for the purposes of this |
|Section shall not require law enforcement agencies to |
|obliterate or otherwise destroy juvenile law enforcement |
|records that would otherwise need to be automatically expunged |
|under this Act, except after 2 years following the subject |
|arrest for purposes of use in civil litigation against a |
|governmental entity or its law enforcement agency or personnel |
|which created, maintained, or used the records. However, these |
|juvenile law enforcement records shall be considered expunged |
|for all other purposes during this period and the offense, |
|which the records or files concern, shall be treated as if it |
|never occurred as required under Section 5-923. |
|||(0.5) Subsection (0.1) or (0.2) of this Section does not |
|apply to violations of traffic, boating, fish and game laws, |
|or county or municipal ordinances. |
|||(0.6) Juvenile law enforcement records of a plaintiff who |
|has filed civil litigation against the governmental entity or |
|its law enforcement agency or personnel that created, |
|maintained, or used the records, or juvenile law enforcement |
|records that contain information related to the allegations |
|set forth in the civil litigation may not be expunged until |
|after 2 years have elapsed after the conclusion of the |
|lawsuit, including any appeal. |
|||(0.7) Officer-worn body camera recordings shall not be |
|automatically expunged except as otherwise authorized by the |
|Law Enforcement Officer-Worn Body Camera Act. |

|||(1) Whenever a person has been arrested, charged, or |
|adjudicated delinquent for an incident occurring before |_|a |_
_|person's|_|||his or her||18th birthday that if committed by an adult |
|would be an offense, and that person's juvenile law |
|enforcement and juvenile court records are not eligible for |
|automatic expungement under subsection (0.1), (0.2), or (0.3), |
|the person may petition the court at any time for expungement |
|of juvenile law enforcement records and juvenile court records |
|relating to the incident and, upon termination of all juvenile |
|court proceedings relating to that incident, the court shall |
|order the expungement of all records in the possession of the |
|Illinois State Police, the clerk of the circuit court, and law |
|enforcement agencies relating to the incident, but only in any |
|of the following circumstances:|||
|||||(a) the minor was arrested and no petition for |
|delinquency was filed with the clerk of the circuit court;|
|||||(a-5) the minor was charged with an offense and the |
|petition or petitions were dismissed without a finding of |
|delinquency; |||
|||||(b) the minor was charged with an offense and was |
|found not delinquent of that offense;|||
|||||(c) the minor was placed under supervision under |
|Section 5-615, and the order of supervision has since been |
|successfully terminated; or|||
|||||(d) the minor was adjudicated for an offense which |
|would be a Class B misdemeanor, Class C misdemeanor, or a |

|petty or business offense if committed by an adult.|||
|||(1.5) The Illinois State Police shall allow a person to |
|use the Access and Review process, established in the Illinois |
|State Police, for verifying that |_|the person's|_|||his or her|||
|juvenile law enforcement records relating to incidents |
|occurring before |_|the person's|_|||his or her||18th birthday |
|eligible under this Act have been expunged. |
|||(1.6) (Blank).|
|||(1.7) (Blank).|
|||(1.8) (Blank). |
|||(2) Any person whose delinquency adjudications are not |
|eligible for automatic expungement under subsection (0.3) of |
|this Section may petition the court to expunge all juvenile |
|law enforcement records relating to any incidents occurring |
|before |_|the person's|_|||his or her||18th birthday which did not |
|result in proceedings in criminal court and all juvenile court |
|records with respect to any adjudications except those based |
|upon first degree murder or an offense under Article 11 of the |
|Criminal Code of 2012 if the person is required to register |
|under the Sex Offender Registration Act at the time |_|the person|_||
|he or she||petitions the court for expungement; provided that 2 |
|years have elapsed since all juvenile court proceedings |
|relating to |_|the person|_|||him or her||have been terminated and
|_|the |_
_|person's|_|||his or her||commitment to the Department of Juvenile |
|Justice under this Act has been terminated.|||
|||(2.5) If a minor is arrested and no petition for |

|delinquency is filed with the clerk of the circuit court at the |
|time the minor is released from custody, the youth officer, if |
|applicable, or other designated person from the arresting |
|agency, shall notify verbally and in writing to the minor or |
|the minor's parents or guardians that the minor shall have an |
|arrest record and shall provide the minor and the minor's |
|parents or guardians with an expungement information packet, |
|information regarding this State's expungement laws including |
|a petition to expunge juvenile law enforcement and juvenile |
|court records obtained from the clerk of the circuit court.|
|||(2.6) If a minor is referred to court, then, at the time of |
|sentencing, dismissal of the case, or successful completion of |
|supervision, the judge shall inform the delinquent minor of |
_|the minor's|_|||his or her||rights regarding expungement and the |
|clerk of the circuit court shall provide an expungement |
|information packet to the minor, written in plain language, |
|including information regarding this State's expungement laws |
|and a petition for expungement, a sample of a completed |
|petition, expungement instructions that shall include |
|information informing the minor that (i) once the case is |
|expunged, it shall be treated as if it never occurred, (ii) |_|the |_
_|minor|_|||he or she||may apply to have petition fees waived, (iii) |
|once |_|the minor|_|||he or she||obtains an expungement, |_|the
minor|_|||he |
|or she||may not be required to disclose that |_|the minor|_|||he or she|||
|had a juvenile law enforcement or juvenile court record, and |
|(iv) if petitioning |_|the minor|_|||he or she||may file the petition |

|on |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||own or with the assistance of an |
|attorney. The failure of the judge to inform the delinquent |
|minor of |_|the minor's|_|||his or her||right to petition for |
|expungement as provided by law does not create a substantive |
|right, nor is that failure grounds for: (i) a reversal of an |
|adjudication of delinquency; (ii) a new trial; or (iii) an |
|appeal.|

|||(2.8) (Blank).|

|||(5) (Blank).|||
|||(5.5) Whether or not expunged, records eligible for |
|automatic expungement under subdivision (0.1)(a), (0.2)(a), or |
|(0.3)(a) may be treated as expunged by the individual subject |
|to the records.|
|||(6) (Blank).|
|||(6.5) The Illinois State Police or any employee of the |
|Illinois State Police shall be immune from civil or criminal |
|liability for failure to expunge any records of arrest that |
|are subject to expungement under this Section because of |
|inability to verify a record. Nothing in this Section shall |
|create Illinois State Police liability or responsibility for |

|the expungement of juvenile law enforcement records it does |
|not possess. |

|||(7.5) (Blank).|
|||(8) The expungement of juvenile law enforcement or |

|Act, other than cases involving those exceptions to the |
|definition of parent set out in item (11) in Section 1-3, then |
|the Illinois Parentage Act of 2015 shall apply and the court |

|may be paid as the court directs, and the payment thereof |

|other person shall be required to pay a fee for room and board |
|at a rate not to exceed $10 per day established, with the |
|concurrence of the chief judge of the judicial circuit, by the |
|county board of the county in which the minor is detained |
|unless the court determines that it is in the best interest and |

|chief judge shall be in the form of an administrative order. |

|court, that parent or other person shall pay the clerk for the |
|minor's room and board. All fees for room and board collected |
|by the circuit court clerk shall be disbursed into the |

|||Upon application, the court shall waive liability for |
|support or legal fees under this Section if the parent or other |
|person establishes that |_|the parent or other person|_|||he or she||is |
|indigent and unable to pay the incurred liability, and the |
|court may reduce or waive liability if the parent or other |

|the person or |_|the person's|_|||his or her||family.|||
|||(2) When a person so ordered to pay for the care and |
|support of a minor is employed for wages, salary or |
|commission, the court may order |_|the person|_|||him||to make the |
|support payments for which |_|the person|_|||he||is liable under this |
|Act out of |_|the person's|_|||his||wages, salary or commission and to |
|assign so much thereof as will pay the support. The court may |
|also order |_|the person|_|||him||to make discovery to the court as to |
_|the person's|_|||his||place of employment and the amounts earned by |
_|the person|_|||him||. Upon |_|the person's|_|||his||failure to obey the |
|orders of court |_|the person|_|||he||may be punished as for contempt |
|of court.|||
|||(3) If the minor is a recipient of public aid under the |
|Illinois Public Aid Code, the court shall order that payments |
|made by a parent or through assignment of |_|the parent's|_|||his|||
|wages, salary or commission be made directly to (a) the |
|Department of Healthcare and Family Services if the minor is a |
|recipient of aid under Article V of the Code, (b) the |

|under Article IV of the Code, or (c) the local governmental |

|||(750 ILCS 30/2)||||(from Ch. 40, par. 2202)|||||||
|||Sec. 2. ||Purpose and policy. ||The purpose of this Act is to |
|provide a means by which a mature minor who has demonstrated |
|the ability and capacity to manage |_|the minor's|_|||his||own affairs |
|and to live wholly or partially independent of |_|the minor's|_|||his|||
|parents or guardian, may obtain the legal status of an |
|emancipated person with power to enter into valid legal |

|||This Act is not intended to interfere with the integrity |
|of the family or the rights of parents and their children. No |
|order of complete or partial emancipation may be entered under |
|this Act if there is any objection by the minor. An order of |
|complete or partial emancipation may be entered under this Act |
|if there is an objection by the minor's parents or guardian |

|only if the court finds, in a hearing, that emancipation would |
|be in the minor's best interests. This Act does not limit or |
|exclude any other means either in statute or case law by which |
|a minor may become emancipated.|||
|||(g) Beginning January 1, 2019, and annually thereafter |
|through January 1, 2024, the Department of Human Services |

|homeless minors older than 16 years of age but less than 18 |
|years of age referred to a youth transitional housing program |
|for whom parental consent to enter the program is not |
|obtained. The report shall include the following information: |
|||||(1) the number of homeless minors referred to youth |
|transitional housing programs; |
|||||(2) the number of homeless minors who were referred |
|but a licensed youth transitional housing program was not |
|able to provide housing and services, and what subsequent |
|steps, if any, were taken to ensure that the homeless |
|minors were referred to an appropriate and available |
|alternative placement;|
|||||(3) the number of homeless minors who were referred |
|but determined to be ineligible for a youth transitional |
|housing program and the reason why the homeless minors |
|were determined to be ineligible, and what subsequent |
|steps, if any, were taken to ensure that the homeless |
|minors were referred to an appropriate and available |
|alternative placement; and|

|||||(4) the number of homeless minors who voluntarily left |
|the program and who were dismissed from the program while |
|they were under the age of 18, and what subsequent steps, |
|if any, were taken to ensure that the homeless minors were |
|referred to an appropriate and available alternative |
